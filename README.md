# The Mechanical Ink Podcast

The Mechanical Ink podcast focuses on the open-source ecosystem, the impact of open source on the world, and the challenges maintainers face. I also speak with other indie founders who are building open startups or who are building in public. From time to time, we also bring on guests to talk about other related topics, such as ethics in tech, civic technology, and the community side of open source.
