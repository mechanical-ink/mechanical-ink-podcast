00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to the Mechanical Inc podcast, a collection of conversations about the open-source ecosystem.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We speak with containers and companies that play a key role in ensuring the health and sustainability of open-source today and in the future.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey Abby and May 3, thanks so much for joining me on the Mechanical Inc podcast.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a huge pleasure.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,360
It's a huge pleasure.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,600
So to let the cat out of the bag,

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,160
here are both from GitHub.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,240
And we are quite big fans to put it mildly off GitHub

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,280
and everything that GitHub does.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,360
And I've known Abby for quite some time.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,200
And so when I started with this podcast idea

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,880
that it's like the second what I'm doing,

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
I thought like, and I heard the announcements

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,080
at the recent GitHub universe.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,800
I was like, I wonder if I can make this happen.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,000
And so I reached out and wow, I was so pleasantly surprised

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
that you were so open to this.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
So again, thank you so much for joining me.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,600
I really appreciate this.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,640
And I'm excited to share all the great stuff

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,920
we'll talk about today with the larger community.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,160
With all of that said, can we get a little bit of background

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,600
on the two of you and what your roles

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,080
have get up in the open source ecosystem?

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,600
Yeah, for sure.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,960
I think I saw.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,200
That's OK.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
Thanks, Deer.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,600
I guess, so I'm Abby Kubinak-Mays.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,960
I lead GitHub's open source maintainer programs

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
where we engage, invest, and advocate for open source

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,160
maintainers.

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,840
I joined about six months ago because I really

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
do want to be supporting maintainers.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,200
So a skull, like you mentioned, we work together at Mozilla.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,480
So it's so great to reconnect here.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,320
But I actually started my career in cancer research.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,440
So I was writing web apps for scientists

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,640
so that they could do some data analysis and data visualization.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
And this was a really meaningful work for me.

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
My grandmother passed away from cancer.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,960
It's this idea that I was helping someone else's grandmother

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,280
was, yeah, really powerful.

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,720
But the longer it was there, the more I realized how often

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,160
researchers sometimes fudge their data a bit

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,840
or maybe not even share it, just to further their own career

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,120
and get cool discoveries out there.

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,960
And I found that that was outraging.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,560
That's why now I care so much about open source and open science.

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,920
I think the best innovations happen when we are doing things in the open and

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
sharing the results that we have.

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,840
So since then I've spent my career really supporting the open source ecosystem

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,800
both for scientists and now more broadly.

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,640
And through this work I've seen that maintainers have truly an outsized impact on the space.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,720
They shape how the kidneys collaborate.

57
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
They're the ones that they're securing funding often.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,100
They're the ones that ensure that the project's

59
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,840
functions sustainably.

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
So I'm really excited to be here at GitHub

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,320
where I'm in a role where I can truly

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,760
be supporting those maintainers

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
and helping more of this open source happen.

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,960
- Yeah, that's wonderful.

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,380
I had no idea about your early start.

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,880
Yeah, that's really interesting.

67
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
Thanks for sharing.

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,280
- Yeah, so for me, I came to GitHub

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
about four years ago.

70
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,980
And I had always sort of been involved in open source

71
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,520
on the adjacency level.

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,480
So I was running an engineering team,

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
talented my former employer.

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,920
And we were using a ton of Cassandra frameworks and software.

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,880
And I remember there was this point in the middle of the night

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,440
and London one day, and we were like,

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,360
we don't know what the hell we're doing actually.

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
Maybe we should get someone who's an expert

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,400
that we can actually talk to.

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,440
And we realized that we had no one

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
that we could actually reach out to.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
And I remember going to GitHub and saying,

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,320
"Oh, there's one contributor.

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,160
"Maybe they'll speak to us.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,280
"Let's reach out."

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,040
And there was this whole shenanigans

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,480
around how we were going to contact this person.

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,560
Finally got them online.

89
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,440
We will literally do anything.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,600
If you will just spend an hour with us, please.

91
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,520
And they were ended up being really helpful

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,760
and helping push our product forward.

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
And I remember that.

94
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,360
And so when GitHub was acquired by Microsoft back in 2018,

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I joined as part of the new leadership team.

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,520
I was chief of staff to the CEO, not three men.

97
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,920
And really my biggest passion for joining

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,440
was how do we get the open source community out front

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,080
and center, how do we support them,

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,120
how do we actually build so that like Abby was saying,

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,960
all of these maintainers really have the tools that they need

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,600
as well as the support that they need

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,240
to be super successful.

104
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,440
Because like Abby, I believe that open source

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
really does push us forward.

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
We're not all doing the same work.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,280
In fact, we can all leverage each other.

108
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,520
So it's the biggest team sport that I can think of across the globe.

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
And so I was cheap as to that.

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
We did a ton of different initiatives like GitHub sponsors,

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,840
and sure we'll get into that later.

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,880
And then now I'm working within the CEO's office for

113
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Thomas, who's our new GitHub CEO, and really focused on the open source economy.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
So how do we get the right players,

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,240
both from the company side as well as the developer side matched up and

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,000
working together so that open source not only can survive over the next decade, but really thrive.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,840
And so that's kind of the focus and why we've launched these last two programs that Skolke

118
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280
just talked about, the accelerator and the fund. And I'm sure we'll get into it just now. So

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,680
that's clever. The background on me. Great. Yeah, thanks. That's exciting. Yeah, for sure.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,760
No, I also definitely want open source ecosystem to thrive. And I do feel like GitHub is playing

121
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:49,040
a key role there and talking to that, I think one of the announcements, one of the many

122
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:58,080
announcements that was made during the universe in 2022, I believe that's the year, is in,

123
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
so there's a couple of ones. So one of the ones is where you're literally investing in the

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,480
stack that you depend on and that is really cool. You don't often see that and I think,

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,800
I hope that's it's a precedent for the industry to like take note that you know it's it's it's the thing you should do

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,240
If you're relying on open source to build your business then you really should invest back into into your own stack at the very least

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
But get up of course it's going above and beyond that and we'll dig into some of those things

128
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,360
But I know some of the stuff that kicked all of this off was a pilot program that was run in India called OAS grants

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm curious if you can share anything about the experience of running that program and

130
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,720
if there's any specific lessons that came out of that that then influence all these

131
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
new initiatives.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah, so Karin who sits in the GitHub DevRal team really brought that program to life.

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,200
He was super instrumental.

134
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,600
One of the biggest learnings was sometimes developers just need the time and the space

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
to go experiment.

136
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,600
a maintainer often what happened is you threw something out there that scratched your own

137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,080
edge and you're like, "Well, I'm going to give this back to the community."

138
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,880
And then fast forward six months later, you get 20 issues a day of people asking you

139
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,120
to do this or do that.

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
And you're thinking to yourself, "Gosh, I really love this project.

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,760
I very much want to work on it."

142
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,440
But I also have a full-time job and a family and a life and this impending doom of issue

143
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,840
this is just coming over the edge and kind of crushing me under the weight.

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,560
And so, you know, you often see maintainers have these almost apology posts.

145
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
And I'm like, don't apologize.

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
You're doing something great for us.

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,840
So they need the time.

148
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
They need this face to actually say, well, what if this could be something real?

149
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
What should I be doing?

150
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,320
And, you know, GitHub doesn't want to be the person who's telling everyone this is how

151
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
the market should work.

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,560
And so the, oh, as grants program was really an experiment.

153
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,320
It was like, well, if we just gave you the money,

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,920
so you would have the time.

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,440
What happens next?

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,120
And I think one of the coolest things

157
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,200
that came out of that program was two of the maintainers.

158
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
I'll just use two as a example.

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
They were 20 in the group, but two were sort of stuck out.

160
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,480
Peter Thomas, who runs Karate Labs, and Leis Thomas,

161
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,480
who runs no relation, totally different people and families.

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Leis Thomas, who runs hot scotch now, both came out of that

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,720
program and then ended up doing other things and raising money, joining YC, becoming full

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,040
flood, open source companies. And that was really exciting to us. And we thought, well,

165
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,960
if more people had this and you had more examples, and not just examples that were going into

166
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,320
venture backed startup paths, we could really paint a path for more maintainers that you don't

167
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,960
have to just feel crushed by the weight of the expectations of the community, and then doing this

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,200
on nights and weekends, but you could actually make this a full-time career or make this a full-time

169
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,240
company. We wanted to start with an experiment. We also started in India because it's the fastest

170
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,720
growing geography for GitHub. We've added more developers in India in the last year than there were

171
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:19,960
on GitHub in 2012, 10 years ago, which is really quite stark from a single region. We were excited

172
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,640
about being able to support this and then also going global. And so it really became kind of the

173
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,760
the seed crystal or the impetus for us building out a more full-fledged program with the GitHub

174
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,440
accelerator, which we launched back at universe a couple of weeks ago here. Yeah, it's very interesting.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,800
Anything you'd like to add to that, Abby? Well, I was just going to say it is really interesting to see,

176
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,040
yes, seeing the engagement in India specifically. I know they had the longest wait list for sponsors.

177
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:57,160
So when it was launched, it suddenly, I know, yeah, there are some of the top people on sponsors now.

178
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,800
So it's exciting just to see it grow and see this expand.

179
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,280
That's great. Yeah, so actually, I wonder if I'm...

180
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,200
No, no, go for it, go for it. Oh, sorry, it's called. I wonder if, I wonder if it makes sense for

181
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,320
us to talk a little bit about the journey here because I would say, you know, OS grants was

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,720
sort of our first experiment on a program side. But back in 2019 was our first big experiment

183
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,720
in this space. We launched sponsors which you go to any GitHub profile that has sponsors turned

184
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,760
on. You can actually just with a single click next to the code that you're using go and sponsor

185
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,240
developer, whether that it's you as an individual. And we also have a beta program right now for

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,800
companies to go do that. And what we've seen over the last three years is so many people want to be

187
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,440
able to do this. I mean, I think people were sort of kind of Frankenstein monstering this

188
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,800
together, right? Like open collective and so many other companies in the space are also doing

189
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,440
this to support maintainers out there. But it's always, you know, you go to the website and people

190
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,000
like, well, you can buy me a cup of coffee and like, this will help me sort of fuel my my night

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,360
work this day or that day. And what sponsors, what we really wanted to formalize was this idea that

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,440
you should be working in open source. It should be out in the open, but it shouldn't be

193
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,080
you know, completely unpaid. It shouldn't be something that we expect from you

194
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,760
just because you happen to have donated your your prior time and energy and talent

195
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,520
to the community. And so sponsors has really had this great rise over the last three years. We've

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,440
you've seen a ton of different examples of people experimenting.

197
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,480
You know, Caleb Porzio is one person, he's done a couple of podcasts and things, you

198
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,240
definitely check them out. But you know, he sort of came on a sponsor's and 2019-2020,

199
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,320
I want to say. And his objective was like, well, can I make $100,000 a year? Can I

200
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,760
replace my paycheck for my employer on sponsors? And very rapidly, he actually did.

201
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,200
And I remember seeing that example and just getting such a surge of energy, I was like,

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,440
"Wow, okay, you should be able to do this."

203
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,700
And there have been other people

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,560
who have been using sponsor as Cindra,

205
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,440
who is a very long time,

206
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,040
Ghehaep contributor maintainer, developer.

207
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,360
He's very active in the community,

208
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
yes, some of the most,

209
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,640
he is I think the highest count of sponsors overall.

210
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,640
And you also see folks like M&U from VJS,

211
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,760
who has built an incredible community,

212
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,280
an incredible organization that is really making sure

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,160
that view has both resiliency and sustainability outside of just his

214
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
contributions, which I find to be really interesting. And so sponsors has gone

215
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,600
through this really great journey over the last three years. And then with OS

216
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,280
grants, you know, the kind of lesson that we're learning is you just need more

217
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,240
of them. Like we need more kind of tinkering and experimentation in this

218
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,080
space. And in some ways GitHub, we just want to be the matchmaker. Like, okay,

219
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,000
you want to go do this. Here are the four or five mentors that you can go talk

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,640
to and then here are the four or five profiles that you should be able to just fork and create

221
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,040
as your sponsors profile. And then here are the, you know, several companies that depend on your

222
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,840
software today and in some ways like your SangSkulk, you know, actually give back because the software

223
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:26,520
that you created powers their products that they make, you know, thousands or millions or billions

224
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,040
of dollars off of. And that volunteer work should be recognized and appreciated and maintained

225
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,440
over time. So you know we've gone through the sponsors trajectory and now we're

226
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,000
sort of coming back and saying what are the small, cool experiments that we can do to give developers

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,080
that time to really focus on their open source projects. Yeah and Skulk I know you mentioned bulk

228
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,720
sponsorships a little bit at the beginning and we did experiment with that back in June as

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,880
part of maintainer month, just we had half a million dollars and we wanted to see Canvias

230
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,440
GitHub distribute this to all our dependencies. So we found all the dependencies that GitHub

231
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,400
as the org and all of our other orgs we have a lot of them uses and there are 900 dependencies

232
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,040
that had sponsors turned on. So we just split the money evenly between all of them and part of

233
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,080
doing that was like writing some tooling so that we could actually get the money everywhere

234
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,480
because it was quite a manual process before.

235
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,920
And so now because of that, like bulk sponsorships is on the way.

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,600
So I'm excited to see this expand both with investing in these individual maintainers,

237
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,240
but also encouraging companies to yet pay for your stack or give money back to your stack.

238
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,480
Yeah, that's wonderful. I love this this way that GitHub,

239
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,920
at Mozilla they call it Fox feeding. I don't know if you call it

240
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Octocat feeding or what?

241
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920
What?

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Get up.

243
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,920
But where you use your own product, right?

244
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
And your own,

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,920
everything, like, kind of organically grows out of the need,

246
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
a need at get up that you then fall

247
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
and then give to the community and say,

248
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
we found this useful, we'll,

249
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
we'll pretty sure you'll find it useful as well.

250
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I love that organic growth of get up.

251
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,920
A couple of things that you've mentioned actually leads me to a different topic

252
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,920
different topic that I was thinking of touching on later, but I think it's a good place to do it now.

253
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:32,920
And so it's, I think India in terms of the regional challenges that they face and also the growth that you've mentioned.

254
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I think Africa resembles that very much. There's a lot of similarities between these two countries, continents, whatever you want to call it.

255
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,920
And I think this idea that...

256
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,780
So the reason why I'm bringing this up,

257
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,480
let me stay back a little bit.

258
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,160
So I've recently found,

259
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,680
so these two different statistics,

260
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,120
I'll talk about the second one a bit later,

261
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,880
but of all open source contributions,

262
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,440
only 3% comes from Africa.

263
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,560
And if you think about the fact that 17%

264
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,520
of the world's population live in Africa,

265
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,720
then it's kind of mind boggling to think why it's

266
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,200
such a small percentage of contributions come from the content of Africa.

267
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,120
But it is for the very reasons that you have highlighted.

268
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,760
For people in Africa, number one is getting a job and number two is getting enough

269
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
money to be able to put food on the table.

270
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,320
And if you have any time left after all of that, you might consider contributing

271
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,080
to open source.

272
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,960
If you have the energy and if you have access to stable infrastructure,

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
which means power, internet and access to hardware.

274
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,160
So, if somebody in Africa had to start an open source project,

275
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,160
it would be very hard for them to maintain that long term

276
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,760
if they get traction on it,

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,800
simply because they won't be able to quit their day job

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,120
and do this.

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,080
They won't be able to say, "I'm gonna quit my job."

280
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,240
And they'll have to burn the midnight oil,

281
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,960
so to speak, and they'll be in the candle at both ends.

282
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,200
because they'll have to go to the day job, make the money to put food in the table, and then

283
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,480
after hours spend time working on this project. And I think things are getting better

284
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,360
so in terms of how people view open-source. And I think language is very important here. That's why I

285
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:33,840
like this name of Ventures and sponsors because I think people it shouldn't be like a donation

286
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,160
because I like the idea of teaching people to fish instead of giving them a fish.

287
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,920
So I think that builds continuity and that helps people grow.

288
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,360
Because later on you can pass it on to the next person.

289
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,920
If you've learned and you've grown and you've learned to fish,

290
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,240
you can teach the next person out of fish.

291
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
Instead of if you just get a bunch of money and it's like,

292
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,520
"Oh, nice, people tend to also not spend it very wisely if you get it, if it's too easy."

293
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,640
So what I'm getting at with all of that is I think these initiatives that get up is starting.

294
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,520
I know there was some negativity towards it because keep money out of open source, but I think

295
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,400
that's the wrong attitude. I think it's one of the things that open source has been missing

296
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,440
is real monetary investment in this space. So I'll, you know, stand the line and say that I think

297
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,560
what get up is doing is the right thing. I'm curious what ideas you have for the African

298
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,960
context and similar countries, not just Africa, and how you think these initiatives that get

299
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,440
up as driving can really impact and allow people in these regions to maybe double that percentage

300
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:56,800
from 3 to 6%. Yeah, I mean, I can jump in and take this one. So, I think, you know, I'm super

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:04,480
passionate about this back in 2019. I took a trip with the GitHub leadership team to Lagos

302
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,760
in Nigeria. And that's only one part of a very large continent. So it's obviously a window into

303
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,560
that world, but not the full picture. And the overwhelming feel of the place was everyone who's

304
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,360
involved with open source, being involved because of the community, the amount of learning

305
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,040
that they were able to engage with, the actual opportunities that it then created, you know,

306
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,520
whether that was job opportunities or other companies that they could join and found together.

307
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,920
But at the end of the day, everyone said exactly what you said, Skolk, which is,

308
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,440
"I need a day job." You know, I don't have the wherewithal, the privilege to be able to not

309
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,740
to take a paycheck.

310
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,680
And open sources allowed me to be discovered,

311
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,960
but it is not the place where I can actually build a career.

312
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,600
And that really bothered me.

313
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,720
Because at the end of the day, all of us building

314
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,960
and clothes silos at companies doesn't quite

315
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
further our joint mission.

316
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,000
There's a lot of rework in that.

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,800
There's a lot of duplicative efforts.

318
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
And so one of the main objectives about the accelerator--

319
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,220
And if I can just sort of kind of take a step back

320
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,900
and explain parts of that accelerator,

321
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,720
is we as GitHub want to start really small

322
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
with a specific set of folks

323
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,280
where we can really show irrespective of geography,

324
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,320
irrespective of career level, irrespective of,

325
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,920
you know, the connections and the people that you know,

326
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,600
you have an ability to be connected to the internet

327
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
and build a project that can be your livelihood.

328
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,760
you know, there's no boundaries as far as open source go.

329
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,960
It's a global community that you can access anywhere.

330
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,640
And so, you know, one part of the accelerator is,

331
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
we're gonna put our money where our mouth is

332
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
for the 10 weeks that you're with us.

333
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,200
We're gonna actually pay and give you a stipend

334
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,640
so that you can support your life in whatever way

335
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,560
and actually have the choice of doing this full time.

336
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,440
And then on the other side of it, you know,

337
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,360
you get connected to this global community of mentors

338
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,080
that you might not be able to meet

339
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,320
if you're running the streets of Legos or Joe Rigg

340
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,600
or wherever you are.

341
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,200
But you actually, we're all in the cloud now.

342
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,720
We don't actually live anywhere.

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,720
And so you can actually build a business or build a career

344
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,240
without any barriers based on your location.

345
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,280
So I think that's one big part of it.

346
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,120
Ezra Lobby, who actually met on that trip,

347
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,280
who was the CTO of Paystack,

348
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,780
it's a YC backed company that's Fintech now in my stripe.

349
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,620
But they really showed a great example

350
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,720
of what this could look like.

351
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,300
They started out in Lagos

352
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,980
and are a globally competitive company

353
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,460
within the stripe family.

354
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,260
So I think that was a big part of what this accelerator is about.

355
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,100
And I hope that many of the participants

356
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,700
aren't from the classical backgrounds of people

357
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,540
in the US where I am or Western Europe,

358
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,380
but actually kind of span the globe

359
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,540
because it is a global talent marketplace.

360
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,580
And I don't think that that should be a barrier

361
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,500
to whether or not you can contribute

362
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,620
and you can build a career here.

363
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,620
So definitely a big, my resounding feel right now is,

364
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,180
yes, I agree.

365
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,500
And so we should be doing something about this overall.

366
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,300
So Abby, I know that you're, as you mentioned earlier,

367
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,460
actually your head of the open source maintainer program.

368
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,100
And I learned about that by accident kind of,

369
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,820
through the grapevine.

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,060
And when I learned more about what exactly that is,

371
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,780
I was like, wow, this is really cool.

372
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,660
I didn't know I had no idea how to get up does this.

373
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,540
So I would love you to tell us a little bit more

374
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,300
about what that program is and how submitted

375
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,420
or some organization or whatever on get up

376
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,860
can become part of that program.

377
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,360
Yeah, of course.

378
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah, did you learn from the MOSVET Slack?

379
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I'm assuming.

380
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,600
Exactly.

381
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,340
So yeah, we do have a set of programs that engage different types of open source

382
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
maintainers on GitHub.

383
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,880
We are still building out a lot of this work, but right now we're doing a lot

384
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
of work with the top maintainers program.

385
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,600
So these are maintainers of key large open source projects that are working

386
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
at scale and with big impact on the ecosystem.

387
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,400
So we used a few things to sort of gather this first with some data.

388
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,800
We called it OctoRank, which is just looking at sort of the size of the community I get

389
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,440
hub, the four stars and different metrics that we have.

390
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,760
But also a lot of manual curation, just looking at the ecosystem and seeing which projects

391
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,240
we thought should be part of this.

392
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
And so for this group, we do meet with them regularly to provide both like a private

393
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,720
space for peer learning, but also support just one-on-one support to make sure that they're

394
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,280
getting what they need out of GitHub and how can really support their communities and continue to grow.

395
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,560
And they're also a nice platform for testing out new features and just getting feedback from

396
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:12,760
these people who are running the open source that is so dependent on by our whole digital infrastructure.

397
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:20,440
So this is quite a different, it's a different, I can't think of that word, it's a different

398
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,040
back, back a profile, profile open source maintainers,

399
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,560
then some of the broader maintainers that we're seeing.

400
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,160
So these are people that are normally like fully

401
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,760
employed to do this work.

402
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,600
And they're working on giant products

403
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,720
and not, not really the small items.

404
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,040
So we're also for the broader open source community

405
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,880
of maintainers.

406
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,440
We do things like maintainer month.

407
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,000
We mentioned a little bit the bulk sponsorships

408
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
that was part of a maintainer month experiment.

409
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,200
Like we wanted to see if we can give this money

410
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,760
to maintainers efficiently.

411
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,920
And yeah, fairly.

412
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,320
So just distributing it equally,

413
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,360
everyone got about $500 USD.

414
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,040
So we partnered with sponsors and the Ospo

415
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,240
for that open source program office here.

416
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,080
But we are still building out our breath maintainers program.

417
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,160
So ways that we can just help your average open source

418
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,320
maintainer who maybe isn't full-time paid

419
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,200
at a company to do this or who's just starting out

420
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,520
or who's running a project that's really highly dependent

421
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,160
by a lot of people, but maybe it's not as visible, so it's maybe lower down on the stack,

422
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,440
so it's a little bit harder for people to see that and want to contribute.

423
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,920
So a lot of what I'm thinking about over this next year, actually, now that we're at the end of the year,

424
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,360
and I'm starting to plan, how do we better engage this broader group of breath maintainers,

425
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:42,400
and how do we give them a place to really learn from each other, and just be successful as maintainers?

426
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,600
So yeah, if you are interested, reach out.

427
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Let me know what you need.

428
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah, that's great.

429
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,240
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

430
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,080
Yeah, no, we'll share the necessary information so people can connect with you.

431
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,240
I think it's in invaluable service to people.

432
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,760
And yeah, there's so many things going on at GitHub.

433
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,800
It's like the JavaScript ecosystem.

434
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,440
It's nearly impossible to keep up with.

435
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,280
So I'm glad you're sharing all of these things.

436
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm talking about supporting various people.

437
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,540
One of the other things that I told, when I mentioned the 3% I saw,

438
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,980
there was another metric that I was curious about.

439
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,280
And that is around contributions from people who identify as female.

440
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,160
Now, there was a study done, which, okay, so first of all, according to data,

441
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,720
it says that around 30% of contributions to open source comes from people

442
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
who identify as female.

443
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Again, a very low number if you take in the ratio in populations.

444
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:54,320
But moreover, there was a study done to look at this idea of masking contributors' identity

445
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
when they open a pull request.

446
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,320
And so all you see is an avatar with a non-descript user name and code.

447
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,680
So that's all you have to go on.

448
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,640
And what they found is, when it's like that,

449
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,800
more pull requests from female contributors were accepted

450
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,280
than from male.

451
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,720
Whereas when you take the blinders off, it traverses.

452
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,360
It goes back to this statistic.

453
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,800
Which is interesting.

454
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,600
So there's some theories around why,

455
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,320
because one of the reasons why you would merge a pull request

456
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,880
is because it's high quality, right?

457
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,520
So they were asking also the question of,

458
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,040
so why is female contributions such high quality,

459
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,480
and why is it missed when you connect the identity to the code?

460
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
So there's, I guess,

461
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,400
cultural things going on there that's a little tough to identify and address.

462
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,720
But the other thing is it's this whole concept that,

463
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,560
yet again, referring to another study,

464
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,480
they found that a female is only likely to apply for a job if she feels

465
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,720
she can fulfill 100% of the job requirements.

466
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
And we all know what job requirements look like.

467
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,040
And for the most part, it's almost impossible

468
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
to fulfill 100% of what is requested

469
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,480
on the job application.

470
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,120
Whereas men will apply if they can only satisfy

471
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,080
roughly 65% of it.

472
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,200
So it's this weird disconnect.

473
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,560
So I wonder if GitHub has done any research,

474
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,440
any experimentation, have any additional insights to you, have any ideas around this like how can we

475
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,560
how can we like make this healthier. But I want to preface before I hand it back to you. I want to

476
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,720
preface that with another piece of interesting information. So there's a person called your

477
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,800
Rundle and Err. I believe is a Microsoft research still. You as like the father of virtual reality,

478
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,120
He talks a lot about social media and he has an interesting thing theory that he shared where he says like

479
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,520
The interesting thing that he's found is

480
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,200
Gett hub is the most successful open

481
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,560
Social network on the internet and I've never really put those two

482
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,320
Together the social network aspect and the code thing, but it's there. It's always been there

483
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,400
I mean, there's even a shirt that I have from Gett hub that says social coding

484
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,800
So the social aspect of it has always been part of GitHub.

485
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:33,120
And his theory is that the reason why GitHub is getting the social aspect right,

486
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:43,040
let's just leave the 13% on the shelf right now, is because there's this sense of a shared ownership.

487
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,600
And there's this creative pursuit that's happening where people are making things together,

488
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,320
and they share this ownership and these things they're making.

489
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,400
And all the other social networks have none of that.

490
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,440
You have creators and you have consumers.

491
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
And the one serves the other.

492
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,480
You almost don't have collaborative things.

493
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,200
The interesting thing is maybe that's why TikTok

494
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,880
is so successful because it has a little bit more

495
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,440
of a collaborative aspect where you can rough off

496
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,960
another person's video and put your little thing

497
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,040
spin on it.

498
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,560
So that's a lot of theories and ideas and research and stuff.

499
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Besides, it's love to give the floor of it through the two of you and just speak to whatever

500
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,560
resonated in all of that with you.

501
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,280
I do think I remember that study you mentioned where the women identified profiles when they

502
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,880
masked them in GitHub.

503
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,920
They were at the pull request where excepted a little bit earlier.

504
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Was that a Mozilla research study?

505
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,080
Am I remembering that correctly?

506
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,560
- I still have had this idea.

507
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,640
It was abandoned, but the study I read wasn't

508
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,960
directly based off of the Mozilla Initiative,

509
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,140
but the Mozilla one had pretty much the same results.

510
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,520
- Yeah, I was just gonna ask,

511
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,320
Nathan, do you have like Demetris' work with Alin?

512
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,400
'Cause I remember her sharing the study that they did

513
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,280
as research preparing for this Alin program,

514
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,040
just to really help increase diversity and open source.

515
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm trying to look at up now so I can share

516
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,520
a little bit more.

517
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,960
But I think when they were looking at it,

518
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
a good percentage of open source contributors

519
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,240
said that they felt welcome.

520
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,640
Like it was like really high 80s or 90s.

521
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,040
But then if they looked at the underrepresented groups,

522
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,520
so those that did not identify as men

523
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,040
or from like different underrepresented groups.

524
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,840
Within that, it was much lower.

525
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
It was like closer to 50, 60%

526
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
that actually felt like they were welcome

527
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
in open source communities.

528
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,760
So just understanding that disconnect was really big for her.

529
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,120
And then she built out this all-in program,

530
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,400
which really partnered with HBCUs,

531
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,600
the Storkley Black University's and colleges in the US

532
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,080
to provide internships for underrepresented groups

533
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,720
and get them into open source.

534
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,960
So I apologize if I'm getting those numbers wrong.

535
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
I think that's like the rough percentages that they had.

536
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,520
And maybe I'll let you chime in if you could think of anything

537
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,240
else.

538
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,300
- Yeah, I mean, I did wanna touch on the social coding aspect

539
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,300
sculpt because I think that's really core to what GitHub is,

540
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,440
which is ultimately when you think about the community

541
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,620
on GitHub and how they're building together,

542
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,780
it is a social endeavor.

543
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,420
It's something that you really depend on this team

544
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,280
of people that you may have never even met.

545
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,420
You may never meet.

546
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,340
You don't even know what their names are, right?

547
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,580
or you know, you're just got the GitHub handle.

548
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,740
And that sort of pursuit that you were talking about

549
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,980
you're on speaks too as well is really beautiful.

550
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,780
Like the fact that you have an entire community of folks

551
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,320
that you can build with together

552
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,780
that you may never know, that you will never know.

553
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,660
But that you are building on the work of others.

554
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,260
You're sure standing on shoulders of diets

555
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,460
if you wanna use the often used global phase, right?

556
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,020
And I think that's what makes me so happy that GitHub exists

557
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,540
and that there's open source.

558
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,700
Open source would still exist out of GitHub.

559
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,960
But it certainly made it easier that a simple pull across

560
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,220
could enable you to learn from and work with some

561
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,020
of the best people in the industry

562
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,060
or the type of technology that you're working on.

563
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,420
So I really appreciate that there is this sense

564
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,780
that GitHub isn't just a fully consumptive

565
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,580
for the classic social networking experience,

566
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,260
but rather as a productive pursuit

567
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,260
where people actually want to move things forward together.

568
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
You're not getting eyeballs

569
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,500
because you've said something controversial

570
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,660
or you've been kind of a jerk in some social networks, right?

571
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,460
But that actually you are helping someone do something

572
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,700
or you're adding to this global network of knowledge

573
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,500
that exists on GitHub.

574
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,140
So for that reason, it's a company

575
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,540
that I'm proud to work for,

576
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,620
but also a community that I'm proud to be a part of.

577
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:12,360
And then to the point around, underrepresented voices

578
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,580
and things like that, I think a lot of this is about

579
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,100
being able to share examples of folks

580
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,500
who have done this successfully.

581
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,940
And I think open source over the last 20 years

582
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,540
has really changed in its overall makeup.

583
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,460
I think we have a lot to do moving forward.

584
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,460
But I am sort of heartened just by the overall

585
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:40,460
all group that have come through all in, like Abby was talking about as well as many

586
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:47,260
of the campus advocates and the thousands of GitHub education participants.

587
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,620
You know, that makeup is vastly different than the current GitHub community today.

588
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,100
So I'm sort of heartened and excited about what the future entails on that side.

589
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Yeah. I'm always, I don't know, I'm grateful that GitHub exists for so many reasons, but yeah, I don't know where, where the, I always wonder where open source would have been now if it wasn't for companies like GitHub.

590
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,420
I mean, you know, like I said, get up is like not the only one,

591
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,500
they get live with theirs, other ones.

592
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,180
Get up is why far the biggest place where social coding is happening.

593
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,660
And I 100% agree that the social aspect is key to GitHub

594
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,620
from the beginning and more so now I guess.

595
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,620
And talking to the controversial thing that gets you noticed,

596
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,180
it's quite the opposite of get up.

597
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,740
like that gets you kicked off the platform so quickly.

598
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,980
It's not tolerated.

599
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,300
It's as if the community on GitHub has decided

600
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,180
that we want this thing to be healthy

601
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,940
and we're gonna do our damnedest to keep it that way.

602
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,220
So, you know, GitHub has put things in place

603
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,620
to assist with that,

604
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,420
but the community itself is doing a lot with that

605
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,660
'cause I've been involved in a whole bunch of open source projects

606
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,300
and probably the biggest one is MDN WebDocs.

607
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,260
And I mean, as the community manager,

608
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,700
I interact with the community obviously on a daily basis.

609
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:23,060
And since I've been the community manager officially

610
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,460
in April this year, I can count on one hand

611
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,460
how many times we've had to click somebody off.

612
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,420
And that's unheard of on a social platform

613
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,860
where you four or five people maybe

614
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,860
in a span of six, seven months that has stepped over the line.

615
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,580
And it's been not really that disruptive,

616
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,580
because we were able to pick it up so quickly

617
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,820
or with this way that you can report internally

618
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,300
inside your GitHub repose,

619
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,020
a community member would flag it for us

620
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,420
and we'd wake up and get up,

621
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,460
shows you a little nice notification board

622
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,260
that's up saying there's one unresolved report

623
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,700
that you need to address.

624
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,380
You go right in there, you can see the context, what happened, and you can say, "Yep, this

625
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,940
is not acceptable."

626
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,260
You do the thing, you report them to get up and you ban them and block them from your

627
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,580
project.

628
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,660
Everything turns into the little ghost avatar and all their stuff's gone and you can

629
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,580
move on with Thursday to the day.

630
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,980
So yeah, it's really amazing.

631
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:38,340
The only thing is I constantly go back to like, "How do we encourage a more diverse audience

632
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,780
to join in because, and I wonder sometimes if the audience isn't more diverse than they

633
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:50,660
may think because I've also heard that there's a lot of people from underrepresented audiences

634
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:59,620
that purposefully change who they represent as on a platform such as, "Do not be judged,

635
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,780
do not be excluded."

636
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:09,380
So I wonder if you really dig into the details, which I don't think that would be very ethical,

637
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,380
but if you put that on the side, I think there's probably a larger percentage of underrepresented

638
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,020
people contributing, but they're not being themselves and that sucks.

639
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,820
You should never feel ashamed of who you are.

640
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,900
You should never hide who you are just to contribute to something.

641
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,980
You should be celebrated for contributing for who you are, not who you represent yourself

642
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:37,180
to be just to not be pushed out. Yeah, I can keep talking about this thing for a long time because

643
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,180
it's a me and I. No, but you like to. Oh, no, no, what I was going to say is, you know, you touched

644
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,980
on a really important part of this, which is, GitHub has this unique ability to allow communities

645
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:53,820
to police themselves. Not, I say police, not in like a scary way, but more of like, hey, you know,

646
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,540
this is how normal human interaction actually works, right? Which is if you're in a front group,

647
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,780
but someone's a jerk.

648
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,860
You're like, we're not talking to this person anymore.

649
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,700
And something that the internet disrupted

650
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,500
was this normal mode of being a human.

651
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,260
What our interactions were going to be.

652
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,100
And a lot of what I think about with open sources

653
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
commits and code are really important.

654
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,740
But a lot of it is this unseen work of people

655
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,900
who are managing the issues, managing community,

656
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,540
talking through discussions, helping people get onboarded,

657
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,620
showing up what good first issues can look like.

658
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,860
And I think there's a lot that we don't talk about

659
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,620
what happens on GitHub in building really healthy

660
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,620
community interactions.

661
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,460
And in other social networks, this just doesn't happen

662
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,500
because there's no productive work to be done.

663
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,540
It is merely a consumptive activity.

664
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,380
And so I'll always say, I really appreciate

665
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,820
and love that you're sort of shining a light

666
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,500
on a lot of the non-coding--

667
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,180
there's a lot of non-coding aspects

668
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,460
that occur on GitHub, like community management,

669
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,060
that really make a huge difference in how that project is

670
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,620
successful and how we function.

671
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,140
So I think I'm glad that GitHub is giving you the tools.

672
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,260
I'm hoping that we're continuing to give you more tools.

673
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,940
Last conference, we just talked about,

674
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,820
you can now turn off all of your profile settings.

675
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,620
So people don't know who you are from the profile setting view.

676
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,180
But you can still contribute to open source in the public.

677
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,860
And I thought that was a really important way

678
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,300
where I agree with you.

679
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,500
It sucks you shouldn't be hiding who you are,

680
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,260
but if you don't want to share who you are,

681
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,620
sometimes people have preferences.

682
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,180
I never wanted to be in the phone book back in the 90s.

683
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,380
People will remember that stuff.

684
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,580
But you should be able to do that

685
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,260
and then still,

686
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,180
productively be an active participant in open source communities.

687
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,820
And I think giving people the choice

688
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,700
and then the tools to do that

689
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,140
is a really important aspect of encouraging people

690
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,280
from all backgrounds to be able to contribute.

691
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,500
- Yeah, I just wanna jump in and say,

692
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,220
I do appreciate how GitHub has added

693
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,300
so much the product over time to really help encourage that.

694
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,620
So especially like the code of conduct picker

695
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,420
and just like surfacing the code of conduct

696
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,100
on the main repo page,

697
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,460
so it's not just hidden as another file there.

698
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,860
I think that made a huge difference

699
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,260
in adoption of code of conducts

700
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,540
across the open source ecosystem.

701
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,740
And then even more recently,

702
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,980
one thing I've been hearing a lot

703
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,980
from the large open source projects

704
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,020
they want to add a little reason on why they banned someone because they found the people kept coming back

705
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:35,180
with different parts of the org or different projects. And I appreciate it. It's on the road map now.

706
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:41,180
Like people are listening to this and adding small tweaks that can make a big difference in how a

707
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:48,380
community is interacting. Yeah, and again, there's just an exemplary example again where you get

708
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,940
listening and actually doing something which is rare.

709
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,460
Oftentimes companies say, "We care, we want to hear what you need and you speak up and

710
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,340
nothing happens."

711
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,940
So yeah, it's great.

712
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
It's great.

713
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,900
I do want to make sure, like, GitHub is responding to its developers not so far.

714
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,500
Like, I don't want us to take all the credit.

715
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,980
This is definitely, you know, the community is pushing us this way.

716
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,900
And it's the community that should really be the one that's highlighted.

717
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,740
But yes, yes.

718
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,500
I'm glad we implemented it.

719
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,140
But certainly not all the ideas were coming for us.

720
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,500
Not for sure.

721
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,180
Not for sure, but the fact that GitHub actually listens, truly listens.

722
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:38,260
There's a difference between listening and just being a, I don't know,

723
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,060
avoid into which people scream.

724
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:45,940
know, it's, I know a lot of these ideas and things come from the community, but the fact

725
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,500
that GitHub takes it too hard and say, you know what, this is a good idea. Let's do this.

726
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:57,500
That is not something that happens a lot. You can look at it with a lot of big corporate

727
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,660
companies and you'll find that you ask for a feature or you report a bug and two years

728
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,940
later it's still there. And you're like, "Mm, okay, I guess they don't truly care about the people who

729
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:15,140
use their software or hardware or whatever the case may be." So three big initiatives were announced

730
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,340
at a universe. The first one was like I mentioned earlier where GitHub is investing in its own stack

731
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:28,260
and then there was two other. The one is focused on enabling people to potentially quit their

732
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,820
they day job and make open source their career, either as a means to an end or as a means

733
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,780
to something bigger, whatever that might be.

734
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,900
And then the other one which was in partnership with M12, which focuses all, again, on investing

735
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,980
in open source, but there the focus is very much on developer tools.

736
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,180
So I had two kind of questions related to that.

737
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,380
The first one is just more information about the first.

738
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:02,380
And then the second one is when you are looking at the developer tools, is there a specific

739
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:09,940
focus there or is it just like general any kind of tooling that improves developer productivity

740
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,820
or whatever the case may be?

741
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,260
Yeah, so I'll take the first one first of, I'll go to the second one.

742
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,220
So for the first one with the GitHub accelerator, I'm just going to take a step back.

743
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,580
So we talked a lot about OS grants and how that was an experiment in India and we wanted

744
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,420
to take that experiment in India and really expand it globally and make it a much more

745
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,540
tailored program for folks.

746
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,340
And I think, you know, I want to start with just like sort of the problem statement because

747
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,740
this is what I heard when I talked to a lot of maintainers.

748
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,580
It's like, you've got a great project.

749
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,140
Thousands of people are using it.

750
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,580
Maybe even millions for all, you know, but you know, if you squint and just hard enough,

751
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,540
it could be your full-time career.

752
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,380
It could be your full-time company.

753
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,620
But right now when you look at open source, like it's sort of ironic because open source

754
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,020
was the original creator community on the internet.

755
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,620
I mean, it literally built the internet

756
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,420
as they were working together.

757
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,420
And in some ways, there's this V path for you as a developer.

758
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,220
Either you're going to go and do 100% employment at a company.

759
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,620
And sometimes, for a lucky few, they actually

760
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,140
get to work on their open-source project while at that company.

761
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,340
I could think of the VS Code team at Microsoft or Flutter

762
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
at Google.

763
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,300
A lot of different teams actually exist

764
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,140
within big tech companies. And you know, you're seeing more and more examples of this, like the next

765
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:36,260
day's community or, you know, drawing five feet, I can name, I can write a lot of a ton of them.

766
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,260
But at the end of the day, that's still full time employment at a company. And then the other

767
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,140
side of the V curve, you could become a founder. You could actually start a company, but oftentimes

768
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:53,700
that means raising money from VCs, signing up to a really exponential growth curve, and then,

769
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,380
you know, oftentimes five years out, you might be looking back on your career and say, "Hey,

770
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,660
I became the CEO of this amazing company, but I'm not a developer anymore. I'm a CEO, I'm a management,

771
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,340
I'm not just diving on my own, and maybe I don't want to build a team, or maybe I don't want to

772
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,980
sign up for this dramatic growth curve that then makes a bunch of promises to people and things

773
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:16,900
like that. And so we saw this v curve and then there's this huge missing middle. It's like,

774
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,740
wow, what about all the businesses that independent developers or independent companies could be?

775
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:29,620
You know, in some ways I'm sort of looking for like that missing fortune 5 million of software

776
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,100
companies. You know, you don't have to be a VC back company. You don't have to do all these things.

777
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,660
But in reality, you could build a really nice lifestyle business. And like, this isn't a fantasy,

778
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,740
you know, this actually happens on the internet a lot. Like if you're an amazing carpenter,

779
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,300
you can have an Etsy storefront and you actually build a really healthy business that sustains

780
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,260
you and your family and there are no further requirements of you or if you're an e-commerce,

781
00:46:52,260 --> 00:47:00,340
knit beautiful sweaters or you have an awesome bar that you want to build, whatever it is, right?

782
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:06,980
You can get a Shopify storefront and you can actually like build a business on that and you have

783
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,780
someone who handles all the infrastructure and eats for you and then you get to just focus on that one

784
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:17,780
thing that you want to do. But software doesn't have that. You kind of have this like vKRT. You have to

785
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,220
choose like okay you can go work for a company or you're going to go start a company and then yes

786
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,140
I think on the margins you've seen some people who do consulting contracts and things like that but

787
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:33,860
that often atomizes development and makes you think of just like an hourly worker versus like a

788
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,860
a true project where this is like the full on business.

789
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,260
And so we're looking at this and they're like,

790
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,380
well, so how do we create more of this missing middle?

791
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,420
And you know, one of the advisors in the accelerator

792
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,260
actually is this person named Mike Param

793
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,700
and he started sidekick and really did an amazing job.

794
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,500
You know, you go to sidekick, go to the website,

795
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,100
it's like, this is a full flush business.

796
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,260
You think it's like 400 people behind it?

797
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,500
No, it's like one person and he has a very active,

798
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,660
healthy community that helps him build sidekick

799
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,660
but they're not trying to be something that they don't want to be.

800
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,100
So one of the things that we're really excited about is having more examples of that.

801
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,740
With the accelerator, what we're doing is we're saying,

802
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,620
we're going to take 10 weeks, we're going to give you the money.

803
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,140
Like I said earlier, we're going to give you mentorship.

804
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,700
But we want to see so many different examples of people.

805
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,100
Maybe it is that you want to go and work for a company on your open-source project or not.

806
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,980
Maybe this is your discovery way to really show off a new skill set

807
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,420
that you have, you know, a unique perspective

808
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,420
and someone wants to hire you for that.

809
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,940
Maybe it's that you wanna be an independent developer

810
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,780
where you have 50 sponsors who are helping you

811
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,700
support this really critical software project

812
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,260
that sits in a lot of people's software supply chains.

813
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,500
Maybe you wanna start a company

814
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,780
but not sign up for this VC backed growth curve

815
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,460
but actually build a, what I would say

816
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,220
like a lifestyle business for you and your family.

817
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:07,300
Or maybe you want to go and start a big company and take VC money and go the full gamut.

818
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,860
But we want to give all of those options available people.

819
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:15,460
And I think the big thing here is how do you create more examples and ways for people to

820
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,100
just say, hey, that's the career I want to take.

821
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,020
Not this or that, but I want to work on this open source project and it can be the thing

822
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,780
that sustains me for the long term.

823
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,740
So that's really the big objective behind the accelerator.

824
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:35,420
And then I can go over to the fund, which is slightly different, but probably along the path.

825
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,380
Yeah, please do.

826
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:42,640
So on the fun side, as we think about that trajectory, you're building a career, you're

827
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
building a company.

828
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:50,180
Maybe you do actually want to start that big company of DC money, etc.

829
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,660
One thing that we really recognize on GitHub is that there are so many companies that are

830
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,980
built on GitHub every day.

831
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,540
We don't have really a hand in that at all,

832
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,820
other than being the platform that supports them.

833
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,780
Often, the best tools for developers are built in open source,

834
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,060
because everyone understands how they're being built.

835
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,860
They can contribute back if they see a feature or a thing that needs to be built on the margin.

836
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,220
What we started to realize is that it's silly that GitHub doesn't help

837
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,900
any of these businesses come to fruition.

838
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,820
It doesn't help any of these developer tools

839
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,820
kind of cross that chasm into a full-fledged developer

840
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,260
product.

841
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,220
And so what we wanted to do was create a way for us

842
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,300
to invest in the community.

843
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,660
And this is an investment fund.

844
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,820
It's actually backed by-- like you were saying,

845
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,140
it's called M12, which is Microsoft's Venture Arm.

846
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,020
We have two great partners in Todd Graham and Franca

847
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,340
Mietra, who are both part of the investment team.

848
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,860
And we're looking to really support people

849
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,800
in that really crucial period where you're going from like a,

850
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,200
a pre-seed to seed, maybe possibly seed to series A,

851
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:06,420
part of the journey where GitHub's insight and how open source products are actually built,

852
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,340
and how you interact with the community,

853
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,700
how you end up moving into an enterprise product,

854
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:19,740
how you, you know, build a relationship with both the community side as well as the customer side.

855
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,300
I think that's something that GitHub is really uniquely positioned for,

856
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:31,620
and something that we really want to help more maintainers become CEOs of really great developer tools companies.

857
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,260
When we say developer tools, they really run the gamut.

858
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,700
The example, our first investment is CodeCE,

859
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,460
which we were super excited about partnering with Shenan team.

860
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,660
And they really sit at the heart of the code review process,

861
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,700
as well as discovering newer repositories as you get started.

862
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,060
And so for us, it was a really complimentary investment.

863
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,540
It made sense because it is so stitched

864
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,580
into how GitHub should be working

865
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,740
as well as what developers need

866
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,540
when they're trying to understand the code based.

867
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,620
You know, they're rocking up to the thing first time.

868
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,060
They're like, well, what happens if I do this or that?

869
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,820
How does this all flow through?

870
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,180
So I think they're a great example.

871
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,340
But as we look out across,

872
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:21,180
We committed a $10 million sum to the fund and we'll be looking to do a set of investments

873
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,900
over the next year. One of the key components is going to be, you know, is this a tool that

874
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,780
really helps developers in their DevOps life cycle? And the second is really, you know,

875
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:36,220
are they building it with a community in mind, whether that's, you know, an open,

876
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:42,620
you know, open core model or with an open source community that is really helping advance and

877
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,860
and augment the product itself.

878
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,820
So that's sort of the objective behind the fund.

879
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,460
I think we've got a lot of work to do

880
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,460
and a lot of ways to show how this partnership actually works

881
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,500
that I think we've got in a great start

882
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,580
and we're excited to partner with more CEOs in this space.

883
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,140
- Yeah, that's great.

884
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,580
Yeah, I think that's perfect.

885
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,540
That is two pair perfectly together.

886
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,540
I'm curious just on the first Wendy accelerator,

887
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:16,540
Who can apply for to horror or to the accelerator?

888
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,940
- Yeah, so the first class is gonna be super experimental.

889
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
So what I wanna say is like,

890
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,620
if you're thinking about any of this,

891
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,380
if you're really excited about it at all,

892
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:30,460
like please apply, we'll figure it out together.

893
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,820
But I think if I had to pick the right lens,

894
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,500
it's someone who's already got

895
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,620
an existing open source project.

896
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,620
You have a good healthy set of users

897
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,660
who are already depending on your software.

898
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,980
You have a view on how you wanna take this full time.

899
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,340
You understand what this could look like,

900
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,940
but you probably don't have all the answers on,

901
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,220
this is a company, this is a vet, this is a vet.

902
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,860
You just really wanna be able to create your job

903
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,940
at work for the internet

904
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,060
and work on your open-source project full time.

905
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,500
And then, I think one thing that is really important to us

906
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,260
is we wanna source developers from across the world.

907
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,340
We're not just looking for one geography.

908
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,300
It's a fully remote program so that it's able to be

909
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,140
participate in it from anywhere.

910
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:24,740
And so for us, it's really about either individuals

911
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,460
or teams of two or three max

912
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,420
who want to be able to take something

913
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,340
that's quite a successful open search project

914
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,020
out in the world today into either a new company

915
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:39,940
or a new career for all the participants.

916
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,100
So that's the main objective that we're thinking about.

917
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,020
And then like I said, if you're still thinking about it,

918
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,460
if you're like, oh, I don't quite fit,

919
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,740
please just still apply.

920
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,380
We'll talk to you and have a conversation

921
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,180
and see what we can do.

922
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,180
- Great.

923
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:57,180
Abby, so stepping over to maintaining

924
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,900
and running this actual open source thing

925
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,860
and the tools to get up provide post universe,

926
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,940
I completed a survey that was sent to me.

927
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,720
And as I've mentioned before, it clearly felt like it was heavily focused around

928
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,840
almost community management, like what I'm doing.

929
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,320
I felt like a lot of the questions were pertinent to me and what I would need from GitHub.

930
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,800
And so I'm curious if you're aware of any initiatives inside GitHub that's brewing

931
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:35,280
and alpha stages or something that is around this way of enabling community managers

932
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,120
or that kind of task-oriented thing

933
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,320
to give people more tools to be able to do this better.

934
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,840
Like I've mentioned, there's some challenges

935
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,840
like keeping your eyes on a big org like WebDocs

936
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,080
that has like 50 repositories, for example.

937
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,000
And then discussions happening and stuff like that.

938
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,640
Do you aware of anything that's coming out of GitHub?

939
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,920
- Yeah, well, first huge thanks for filling out that survey.

940
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,280
we appreciate your data and your input there.

941
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,920
And I do want to tell you a little bit about the survey itself.

942
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,560
So that was actually run by Grace Forerunner.

943
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,440
She's the research partner for the communities,

944
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,600
or-- and that survey really was to learn how we can help

945
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,200
maintain or to build community.

946
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,560
So exactly what you're looking at.

947
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,840
And we want to hear exactly from people like you

948
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,400
so we can build--

949
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,720
oh, we can build products that--

950
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,640
that's OK.

951
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,720
Bless you, Nate.

952
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
Thank you.

953
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,440
We do want to be able to build products that really helped maintainers do this.

954
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,680
And a big reason why I came to GitHub actually was because they put this

955
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,800
community's work together. So it's run by Stormy Peter. So you may have

956
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,360
overlapped with that Mozilla at Skolk. So she was working at MDN back in the day.

957
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,960
But when I saw that she had come, yeah, when I saw that she had moved over from

958
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,560
Microsoft over to GitHub, I got really excited. And it was nice to see that

959
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,360
they were putting this whole part of the work together that was that's

960
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,360
meant to really serve the open source community and really support the open source community.

961
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,600
So part of that is an engineering team that builds products like discussions, like you mentioned,

962
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:14,640
achievements, the feed and the profile. But it also includes parts like education, dev route,

963
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,520
open source, and some docs because the documentation is a big part of this too.

964
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:26,960
So yes, there is lots of things on the radar for open source maintainers for building community.

965
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,200
I can't talk about very many of them, but we did lunch a bunch of stuff over at GitHub Universe.

966
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,600
And like the biggest ones lately is like GitHub sponsors, the book sponsorships,

967
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,760
I think that will be great for maintainers. But I did want to say that there is a whole part of the

968
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,040
org and like hundreds of people thinking about this and working on this. So if you have input

969
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,160
fill out surveys, please reach out to me, reach out to us, let us know your feedback and what

970
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,920
what pain points that you have or what like feature quests that you have because we really do

971
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,800
do want to be helping you thrive on GitHub.

972
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,120
- Yeah, that's brilliant.

973
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,040
I'm super excited to see what's coming out

974
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,360
like now I'm even more excited.

975
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,040
- I'm gonna say, so the survey itself,

976
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,600
I did ask Grace a little bit about what they found there.

977
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,680
And like we've been talking about,

978
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,040
they found that a lot of maintainers

979
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,400
are doing this in their spare time

980
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,960
'cause we surveyed the top 1000,

981
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,680
so maintainers for the top 1000 open source projects,

982
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,320
using the same rank that we did

983
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,480
for the top maintainers that I mentioned before,

984
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,720
but also contributors and users.

985
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,280
And so many of these maintainers

986
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,720
who are just doing this in their spare time

987
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,280
and really community building was quite a low priority

988
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,840
for them just 'cause they're just trying to survive

989
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
as an open-source project

990
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,960
or they're just trying to grow the project in the first place.

991
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,320
So the survey responses will help us prioritize

992
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,160
making discussions more useful,

993
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,760
especially for Q&A type questions.

994
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,280
We found that was really helpful.

995
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,200
And we wanna learn how to incentivize

996
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,400
can you to help each other out. Big feedback we heard was like,

997
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,440
maintainers felt like they were the ones answering all of the stuff on

998
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,600
discussions. So that's really with the research found. So I think we'll be

999
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,920
able to see some work in that area soon.

1000
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,360
Yeah, it's super exciting. I'm really glad to hear that. Because I do

1001
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,120
think there is definitely a opportunity to forget up there. Where

1002
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,480
there is definitely a need and the fact that you all are thinking about it

1003
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:27,720
wonderful. So in closing, this was a wonderful conversation and I'm excited about all the things

1004
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,760
to get up to doing and the things that's coming down the pipeline. I'd like to hear from each of you.

1005
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:45,480
What are your hopes for open source and open source communities and the role open source can play

1006
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:52,760
in bettering our world. Before I answer that, can I answer your other question that I heard

1007
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,680
when I could hear you but could it have to be off? You're asking about like task lists and roadmaps

1008
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:05,880
and stuff? Yeah, I just was like people are so excited about that. The task list feature.

1009
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,640
That's the first time a maintainer asked me if they can turn it on their org before I even knew

1010
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,120
what it was. So the day it was staff shipped, so it was available for me as staff, but I hadn't

1011
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,400
opened an issue yet. I got a message from CNC app. They were like, "Oh, can you turn this on for us?"

1012
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,600
I'm like, "What are they talking about?" And it wasn't until I actually opened an issue and I

1013
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,880
saw it. I was like, "Oh, this is what they want." They found out so fast and they were so excited

1014
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:34,520
about it. So I agree with you, like, these tools that can help you actually manage your project

1015
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,720
and do the work without leaving the GitHub platform. I think it's so valuable for a maintainer's.

1016
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,360
and it's really exciting to see that come through.

1017
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,680
So coming up, I know a big thing for open source that I'm excited about.

1018
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,360
They're going to be really seeing a secret scanning for public repositories.

1019
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,000
So that's launching December 13th.

1020
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,680
So by the time this podcast comes out, it should be there.

1021
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,880
But right now, secret scanning is only available for,

1022
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,320
I could have advanced security, which is like an add-on for enterprise.

1023
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,040
But now on all public repositories,

1024
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:12,520
you'll get notifications if like secrets are accidentally committed to your code. So I think

1025
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,200
this will be huge for open source and just making sure that we're keeping open source secure

1026
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,440
because I know security has been a huge topic the last few years especially. So that's what I'm

1027
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,000
kind of excited about product-wise. And now I can answer your other question, Skulk.

1028
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,360
Yeah, and I think it's a big question that you have and sort of what are my hopes for the open

1029
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:37,560
source ecosystem. I think I want to keep seeing maintainers supported and I do want to see

1030
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,440
your average maintainer supported. I think we're doing a great job with with the most visible people

1031
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,440
and there already are structures in place for them to get like the grant funding and like the

1032
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:52,520
the sponsor's funding, but I would like to see more from your average maintainer who maybe is a

1033
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,080
little bit less visible maybe they're not creating the flashy content or streaming. It's just a

1034
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,520
a little bit harder for them to get the attention.

1035
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,960
So I do want to create spaces for that group

1036
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,440
to get the support they need both financially

1037
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,560
but also just from each other.

1038
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,760
It is really lonely maintaining a community.

1039
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,360
You don't often, you don't have a ton of peers

1040
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,440
that you can turn to.

1041
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,560
So even just creating a space where people can talk

1042
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,080
to each other, this is a lot of what I'm thinking about now.

1043
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,320
I'm thinking about how can we curate this kind of community

1044
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,360
for maintainers to learn from each other

1045
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,880
so that the whole community can just level up

1046
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,960
and you can have better open source.

1047
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,220
I couldn't agree more with, yeah, I mean,

1048
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,000
I can't agree more with Adi.

1049
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
You know, as I said at the start,

1050
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,320
we want open source drive.

1051
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,400
And this is not something that we,

1052
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
you know, are thinking about on a one or a two

1053
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,400
or a four year scale.

1054
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,040
It's on a decade level scale

1055
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,640
because our whole world runs an open source.

1056
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,840
It doesn't matter if you're a tech company

1057
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,680
or any company.

1058
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,280
I mean, you look at the light bulbs in your room,

1059
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,680
the car that you drive,

1060
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,760
the software that you use on your computer every day,

1061
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,280
all of it depends on open source.

1062
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,200
And it is really our responsibility.

1063
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,960
And our interest is a community of developers

1064
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,240
to make sure that it can support itself

1065
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,560
and have the right community members and connections

1066
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,680
so that people continue to contribute open source

1067
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,240
instead of, again, going back into their close silos

1068
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,080
and starting to do the same work that everyone else is doing.

1069
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,880
And I think, as we've seen over the last decade,

1070
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,120
like open sources really want,

1071
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,560
it's the model that just makes sense

1072
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,480
and will continue to do a better job

1073
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,280
than people working alone.

1074
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,960
And so to the extent that we can give maintainers the tools that they need to manage their community or run their software and

1075
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,200
the support they need financially and

1076
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,000
I want to say like mentally or or

1077
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,740
as psychologically, spiritually whatever it is so that people

1078
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:46,080
Really feel welcome in the community and know that they can build their careers and their companies for the long term. So

1079
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Hopefully we're making some steps towards that and I know we got a lot more work to do and we just need to continue forward.

1080
01:03:52,480 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah, that's all great. I love that love it. Yeah, no for me as well. I see open source playing a key role in in how we work how we work together and what we make

1081
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:13,960
And I think I think there's there's a lot of promise and I think there's a lot of opportunities for people in places like Africa, India

1082
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,880
The all these developing nations. I think there's a lot of

1083
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:28,080
By enabling people to make things, I think it'll naturally be a positive impact on communities.

1084
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:36,080
And when communities get healthy, it rolls over.

1085
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:42,080
And eventually it flows into the country as a whole and countries and then the globe as a whole.

1086
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,080
So I think this is a wonderful thing.

1087
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,280
I've been in open source for so long that I can't even imagine myself working or doing

1088
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,400
anything else.

1089
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,200
So I want to again thank both of you for joining me.

1090
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,360
I really, really appreciate this.

1091
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:01,480
It means a lot to me that GitHub is so open to speaking with the community, which you've

1092
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,680
proven again today.

1093
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,200
And so thanks for anything you do and keep doing it.

1094
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,440
The open source, the whole open source community is behind you.

1095
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
So thanks very much.

1096
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,440
