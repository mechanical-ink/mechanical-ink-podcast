00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to the Mechanical Inc podcast, a collection of conversations about the open-source ecosystem.


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We speak with containers and companies that play a key role in ensuring the health and sustainability of open-source today and in the future.


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Hey Jennifer, thanks for joining me on the Mechanical Inc podcast.


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So how are you today? How has life treating you?


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.160
I mean, it's Friday, so it should be a relaxing moment, but usually it's a, okay, you've got to get


00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.040
shit done for the rest of the week moment, but that's going to have to be here.


00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.400
Yeah, yeah, same here. So I learned about you through a colleague at a client I work with


00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.360
Mazzala and specifically the Indian WebDocs team. She's called Ruth John. She kind of knows you


00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.600
from my dad understand. Maybe she knows of your work. Maybe she doesn't know you personally,


00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.120
but she shared an article you wrote about what the fuck is wrong with open source communities.


00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.200
That's a good read. Let me read that. The funny thing is it's interesting to me from a different


00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.120
perspective. It's a different couple of perspectives. So let me lay those off on the table. So


00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.600
I run a company called Mechanical Inc. It's been a company for a long time just as a way from


00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.600
me to work with international clients. But I didn't really have a, I don't really think about what


00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.720
I wanted to do with it. But over the years I started feeling more and more like maybe I should do


00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.880
something with this instead of just, you know, working for somebody maybe there's something useful


00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.040
like and do because for me, I want the work that I do to be meaningful and impactful as


00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.920
much as possible.


00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.560
And so I try to find people and clients that I can work with that has a mission that I


00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.560
can believe in.


00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.240
And that's one of the reasons I started contracting with Mozilla way back in the day.


00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.480
But in the last year, I found what I wanted to do with Mechanical Inc.


00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.800
And that is for it to be an open source company that focuses on the open social ecosystem,


00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
but then also a civic and ethical tech.


00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.960
Because I think we're in an inflection point when it comes to tech in general.


00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.560
Some of it is painful for a lot of people, some of it is necessary evil.


00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.800
And some things have just been let go without too much constraint being put on it.


00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.480
And so yeah, I don't want to do another agency building websites for other people.


00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.640
What I do meaningful work.


00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.960
But then on the mesilocyte, I was part of the MDN WebDogs project, which is a massive


00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.360
open source project.


00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.680
And I love what it stands for and what it does and the opportunities for people to learn


00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.520
how to make websites in a way that's easily accessible, that's free and all that kind of stuff,


00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.360
and be able to contribute back to it. And so in April this year, I smit from being the


00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.840
front-end engineer on the project to being the community manager for WebDocs. And that is where


00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.560
I started digging into the community aspects more and more and more. I kind of always did it,


00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.960
than that's why I was the natural choice and we started looking for somebody.


00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.280
But now having done it for a while I've been digging into all the things and I've


00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.600
realized some of these problems that I wasn't entirely aware of. Some of them are wise,


00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.840
some of them are wise. So that is why that article was very


00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.160
well-timed for me because I was starting to feel that


00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.880
WTF feelings and so when that came across by path I was like this is the perfect


00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.200
combination of things. Me finding my way with the company, what I do in Mozilla and this article


00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.680
you've written and I was like I have to speak to you. So that is a very long way, I'll tell you how


00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:32.040
we got to today. So I think with all of that said I'm going to shut up and then I'm going to...


00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040
Well, I have a question for you.


00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040
Shoot.


00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.840
Because you said something that is a bit contradictory,


00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.240
or maybe as an oxymoron.


00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
OK.


00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.840
You said you wanted to be an open source company.


00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.240
What do you think that is?


00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.040
And what does that mean?


00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.640
So it's a combination of things for me personally.


00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.440
So other than being an open source company,


00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.840
it's also a open startup.


00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.440
So that means everything we do is transparent.


00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.960
That includes salaries, that includes our expenses,


00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.240
that includes any income, regenerate profits we make.


00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.920
All of that I'm busy. So for the longest time, the company also did no website.


00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.920
It does have a website now and I'm currently working on the /Open page,


00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.560
which is where you share all these statistics. And that includes


00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.880
Harby approach hiring, for example. I hate this idea that because you live in India,


00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.000
you get paid a quarter of the salary of some of you who lives in the Bay Area.


00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.640
And I know it's, there's a happy middle ground you need to find.


00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.960
Because, you know, as a company that runs in South Africa, I also only have the


00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.040
monetary capabilities that I have as a company in Africa.


00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.400
But I don't want to use those salary scales.


00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.600
Like when I employ, I want to employ with what's fair for the work you do,


00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
not where you live.


00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.400
So that plays into it.


00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.240
So you're an ethical company.


00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.960
You're a transparent company.


00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.920
I don't think you are in an open source company.


00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.440
You are an open company.


00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.560
You're a transparent ethical.


00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880
These are all great things.


00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.960
I would say as an intro to those that maybe are less familiar with open source


00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.120
or haven't thought of it as a business,


00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.920
open source is not a business model.


00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.160
Because open source inherently, you are licensed,


00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.360
open source is a community,


00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.400
but it is hard is the open source software,


00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.560
which means, or can be open license,


00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.040
creative comments, images,


00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.960
any creative work that creative workers are doing.


00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.440
And, but you are, if you're doing a true open source license,


00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.360
not some MongoDB stuff, things like that,


00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.980
You are saying that anyone can use your code, including to profit off of, including for


00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:09.740
unethical reasons, including to build a website that spreads hate speech, things like that.


00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.340
So I'm arguing you are not open source company.


00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.020
You are a company that maybe utilizes open source tools, participates in open source


00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:26.900
communities, maybe consults open source communities. And you strive to be transparent and ethical,


00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.740
but I would say, and this is the problem with open source. So open source as a whole,


00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:38.260
and it's interesting because this isn't something I discussed in that article, but then someone


00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.540
brilliantly responded to my article in a comment and discussed it. And this is very true.


00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.780
Open source is a great thing in some ways, but is inherently flawed, which leads to inherent


00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:56.580
huge problems with diversity, equity, and inclusion, belonging, as it were, because it is based


00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:02.660
on voluntary work. And who already does more than three-quarters of the voluntary care work in the


00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:10.020
world, women, and people of color, etc. As you grow into the intersectionalism, these are more marginalized


00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.580
people, people marginalized by tech, not by themselves tech is marginalizing them. So what's happening is


00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:24.660
tech as a whole somewhere in between 20 and there are many problems with diversity and tech. It's


00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.900
easiest to talk along the binary because that is typically what most companies and specifically open


00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.740
source companies and open source surveys are targeting. Typically they can do they're doing


00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:46.260
the binary and where people are. So that means tech in general we're talking about


00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:55.140
20 to 23, 24 percent women. And that's across the board at least for graduating from Qtor Science


00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:02.660
degree. When you talk about open stores, yes, the Google Summer of Code and all these fantastic


00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.380
programs that are these internships that are really positive, maybe are about that. Maybe


00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.780
do have like a 23% women participants. But as you go along, you have, I'm trying to remember


00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.020
my friend Bianca, my friend in the world of tech called it a I'm going to look it up because it's


00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.380
a word I hadn't heard before, but she I think coined Bianca Trinkenreich coined the term.


00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:37.140
It's right there. I will find it. But basically people leak. So we're we're ending up with maybe


00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:45.060
be three to 4% women and non-binary people contributing to the tech community.


00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.580
Now, the New Linux Foundation Survey of Diversity Acquing Inclusion last year was up there


00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.220
at like 14%, which is mind-boggling compared to any other surveys.


00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.460
So I really need to dive into their statistics and everything.


00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.740
But there's a leak and it doesn't just usually, when it's in open source, it doesn't


00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.240
usually just affects the individual open source community.


00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.020
It affects the whole open source community


00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.220
'cause people are less likely to,


00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.360
if, and then it affects the tech community


00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.200
because women are much more likely


00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.460
and people might not be sure


00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.860
are eyes by tech and the world are more likely to quit tech.


00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.860
So they invest in all that time and energy


00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.640
learning with this girls set and then they quit


00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.940
because they feel ostracized and stuff.


00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.940
So that's a long way around to say,


00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.060
I think you can have a resource mindset.


00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.540
You can have an open mindset, you can return to transparency,


00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.580
but I don't think you are technically an open source company


00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.740
because open source is still defined inherently


00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.100
in that license.


00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.060
So if everything you're doing was licensed under MIT license


00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.780
or one of these licenses, it could be.


00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.260
And there's such a thing as an open source mindset


00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.060
for better, for worse, things like that.


00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.020
that there inherently can't really be a business


00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.820
around open source.


00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.700
You can build a business, an abstraction layer on top


00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.380
of open source because open source


00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.780
is inherently more complex code.


00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.740
And you can find a way to make it simpler


00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.220
and provide a service.


00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.860
But you're not open source then,


00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.020
you're proprietary on top of open source things like that.


00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.660
Now it's a tricky thing.


00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.780
So open source is a very odd duck.


00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.860
And because it still relies on volunteer work ends


00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.380
or companies that the larger projects are sponsoring it


00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.460
and then paying their developers, their engineers,


00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.620
their even marketers, community management people


00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.140
as their day job to contribute to it is the other way


00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.140
And then we know the largest companies in tech


00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.740
and in the world also have diversity,


00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.820
equity inclusion problems.


00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.700
So it's a full cycle.


00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.060
So those are the two ways most people are coming across.


00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:09.060
So like in 2020, there was a huge up increase


00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.140
and it's wonderful in that way of people contributing


00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.140
to open source because they were bored.


00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.900
(laughing)


00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.380
And that's a great way to, and there was a downturn


00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.500
the economies of some people who are losing jobs, but they're also, they had all this time


00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:30.020
on their hands to make bread and to contribute to open source. It's a great way to get


00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:37.740
example of work and to contribute to a community and get a network. So you get proof of work


00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:45.700
and you have a network. But who whose lives got harder when schools were closed? Full


00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:52.420
circle again. I'm sure if we look at the statistics. Parents but mostly women


00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.180
were not able to contribute more. People of color who are more likely to be


00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.860
taken care of older or disabled relatives, statistically much more likely to


00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.860
be living in intergenerational households. Not able to. Those that can't afford to


00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.380
have internet when they're working from home or don't have a place that they


00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:30.380
can have background because member of virtual backgrounds didn't work for black people for months on zoom because they would just be head them. So there was just a whole cycle of different problems with that so open sources of reflection of problems of society.


00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:39.380
It can be a great thing, but it can also be a mess because you can have hundreds of thousands of people in a community and it can tend to be.


00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:53.260
more of the free fraud. Yeah, yeah. So, okay, that's interesting. So, you cannot truly be an


00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:59.660
open-source business because if that's the case then you need to be kind of like a nonprofit,


00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:07.100
right? That's the only feasible way of being a truly open-source company. If you are not,


00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.020
So your code is all freely available.


00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:19.180
And then you stack ethics on top of that to, in an attempt, to try and prevent people from using


00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:28.940
your software for nefarious purposes. There is a new license coming about, about that,


00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.700
an ethical use license, because I think that is the only fair situation. And that's happened


00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.740
Google like they had walkouts and all but they're AI there a lot of Google is open source a lot I


00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:49.660
Android Kubernetes these all came out of there but they were getting contracts with the US government


00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:58.140
guess US government spends money on tech with only really on defense the rest of it is pretty


00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:14.140
So, and people walked out and things. So that is something that's happening with like open source tooling WordPress WordPress is a business that provides templates and things but it is also an open source company.


00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:23.140
or not company. It's an open source product. It is a company that is the main sponsor of an open source product.


00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.140
And it sells things, but you can also get a WordPress site for free.


00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:33.140
It does definitely have less value for an SEO perspective and things like that.


00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:40.140
For speed things like that, but you can still do it. Anyone can spin one up, can fork it.


00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.740
But yeah, that's how that works.


00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.140
You, but they still can't restrict.


00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.740
What you use it for as the free use case.


00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.040
If someone used it to build an anti trans troll farm.


00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.340
They can't restrict that use.


00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.340
There are other ways people can put pressure on different things,


00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.940
but.


00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.740
That they can't and still be considered open source,


00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.840
but there is talk of a new ethical open source license.


00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.840
I don't know where that is. I'm very excited for it because I think that is a problem.


00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.120
Yeah, and I mean, too, that sounds really good. I would like to support that.


00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.520
I'll definitely do some research and try and find one information about it.


00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.240
So how would you rephrase the, I don't know, how you would call yourself? So if you would say,


00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.800
like, I'm an open source company that's also into ethical and civic tech. I was like, oh,


00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.800
but an open source company, it's not quite accurate. How would you rephrase that?


00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:45.360
open source friendly. I mean everything we bold is open source and you can use it for whatever


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.640
nefarious reasons but we would like you not to do that but of course we can restrict you from


00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:58.640
doing that. Currently at least hopefully this licensing as a way of enabling us to do that,


00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.400
it's going to be hard, it's going to be legal, legal easy, it's going to have to play a role there


00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:11.280
and that's expensive. Also participating in creating the code. That's another thing who is seeing


00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.560
the roadmap. This is what comes up. MongoDB, I'm not trying to be harsh on them. I'm not a data


00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.560
scientist. I don't, I've never even forked anything. So I'm not, I don't tack, I write about tack,


00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.160
but they're always the example. They created their own air quotes, open source license.


00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:38.480
From other reasons than anything else, like outside pull requests do not get accepted. They


00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.760
keep everything locking key. It's like at least 98% of the code is written with by staffers for MongoDB.


00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:55.760
They don't publish a roadmap. So when updates come out, it's kind of like, oh wow, look,


00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:02.800
which has happened. No one knew it was coming, things like that. But they are a successful business.


00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:11.280
They are publicly traded. Like they do have the ability to... I don't... they can't be under


00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.080
open source and I have not read their license details to understand, but maybe they... under


00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.600
their license could stop because of use of summaries and they tried to... yeah, but there are still


00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.400
companies like Perkona building on top of it to try to abstract complexity and things and they


00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:36.480
then market themselves as this alternative and the ethical open source. So it's spinning something.


00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:43.280
But I mean, you can be have open source in your mindset and all. I just don't think you're


00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.200
a company or an open source business. Open source is a mindset and especially it's a community.


00:18:50.240 --> 00:19:00.240
So you and on the other hand, there are tons of proprietary software that have created wonderful communities as well.


00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:18.240
And Slack is a great use for all of those Slack works, whether you're a little company, you're a bunch of, you're trying to crowdsource even though you're not open source, you're trying to crowdsource technical support or support or you're trying to build this whole enriched community around open source.


00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240
Yeah.


00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240
I know.


00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.240
Yeah.


00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240
So interesting.


00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.320
So yeah, I think one of the example examples of that


00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.560
nefarious use is what happened with audacity.


00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.320
So audacity is open source.


00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.160
It's probably was the most popular open source audio


00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.720
editing tool.


00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.160
And then it was purchased by another company


00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.960
and injected full of spyware more wear.


00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.120
And your data ended up being sent back to headquarters


00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.040
located in Russia.


00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.040
And so, but thankfully there was a moment in time


00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.520
where people could forget before that change happened.


00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:13.720
And there's one or two variants now of audacity around.


00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.120
But of course, somehow, I don't know,


00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.260
some other community that was involved with Odacity


00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.920
just left instead of moving to these new forks,


00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.720
which is interesting,


00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.160
'cause David's also talked a while ago


00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.520
about forking WordPress.


00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.680
I don't know if that ever happened,


00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.640
but this was like during the Grittenberg stage,


00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.520
where I was switching everything to Grittenberg


00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.160
and like the accessibility of WordPress's admin


00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.160
stuff degraded quite a bit and then there was this thing but I think people in


00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.200
learnt that there's an an error problem in forking WordPress in that you by doing that you


00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:06.320
you also inherit all the technical debt. I heard that from the the due to bulk ghost which is


00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.920
also an open source project that a company is built on top of which is kind of like a blogging


00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.520
platform it started or focused on journalists journalism but now it's more a way of


00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:24.080
generally just being able to make money from your own content. You can host yourself, you can


00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.200
host it on their cloud servers, they have like striped integration all that kind of stuff. I have


00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.040
an issue with the striped integration which we can maybe dig into a little bit because it


00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.280
it plays into the exclusionary nature of some of these things but they so the person who started


00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:52.160
ghost. He was the lead UX person at WordPress. And so he's first inclination when he got


00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.320
the idea for ghost was to fork WordPress. But then that same thing came up. It's like,


00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.840
now you're inherently inheriting all the problems of WordPress. So first, before you can do anything


00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.680
innovative, you have to step back and solve all the bad things that you don't like or that's broken


00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.680
or they just need fixing or it's a massive.


00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.080
And then you have to open source that.


00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.000
You have to open source that.


00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.960
So then they could fork it back or something.


00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.720
They can-- everyone benefits from it.


00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.920
But do you-- are you comfortable with everyone benefiting


00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.200
from it?


00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.840
Are you comfortable with building a better WordPress


00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.760
and then someone somehow making millions of dollars off of it?


00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.080
Are you comfortable with you not getting any of that credit?


00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.680
which is okay, some people are like that.


00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.680
But then it depends on how big of a community is too.


00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.160
So much of like the modern cloud native stack


00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.800
has these pieces in it that are from a single maintainer.


00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.200
Like a single person is maintaining,


00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.160
single person maintains pearl.


00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.240
Like, and they do it great, but in sales,


00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.280
they always say hit by the bus,


00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.440
but I heard a different last year's coupon,


00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.800
which is what if someone wins the lottery suddenly?


00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.920
Are they going to still continue maintaining it?


00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.760
What if something happens to them, things like that?


00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.160
There's a positive and negative to open source in every way.


00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.520
But the only solution that is going forward right now


00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.540
is to get more people involved and persuade more people,


00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.000
persuade more companies, I guess,


00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.040
if people can do it to invest in open source.


00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.160
If you're using open source,


00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.320
you should be investing in it.


00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.200
You should be paying your staff to contribute to it.


00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.720
But in the meantime the communities need to find a way to


00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.760
motivate a


00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.760
mostly voluntary community


00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.800
like community leadership, but the community itself. So


00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.340
Yeah, there's a couple of things I'm going to dig into there just just to like cycle back on the striped thing like


00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.400
Oh, like I live in South Africa. So


00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.480
and


00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.480
for the entire African continent


00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.200
Stripe is still not available.


00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.600
Like I can pay somebody if you use Stripe,


00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.080
but I can't use Stripe to accept money.


00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.080
Now, as a result, I have stumbled upon many things


00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.960
like Substack, like Ghost Pro and other services


00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.600
where it makes it possible for you to, for example,


00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.840
create educational material in a nice environment


00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.400
where it supports markdown, it supports embeds of video


00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.400
of like little code snippets, code editors, all these things, which is super nice.


00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.760
But then when you want to think about, okay, what can I do for a membership tier?


00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:51.360
It says connect stripe and I'm like, I'd like to, but I can't. Then stripe has this thing called


00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.680
stripe atlas, which allows you to incorporate as a company and Delaware in the United States.


00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:06.320
but that costs $500 to start off with and then $100 per year to keep that going.


00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:12.240
It goes to where of this? I'm sure they should be, but I was thinking of


00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.520
you didn't say that yeah I would bring it to their attention they may not know and they may choose to


00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.440
also integrate with another payment provider. That's the interesting thing. According to their


00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.800
docs you could use PayPal but if I follow their docs and how it's supposed to work it doesn't


00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.800
It doesn't align with the product.


00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.800
Part of the problem, docs are one of those things when you have a mostly volunteer community


00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.800
or also at corporations.


00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.800
These are something that the majority of engineers creating code don't have time or


00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.800
energy or inclination to create an update docs.


00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.800
So, and guess what? A lot of these different things need recognition too.


00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.800
If you have an amazing docs person in your community, you need to recognize the


00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.200
the fuck out of them if they are providing that sort of stuff.


00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.160
So you as a community member need to report


00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.160
or maybe you ask, why is this not working?


00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.960
Figure out if they can fix it or you can fix it


00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.400
and then you could contribute updating that documentation.


00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.320
- Yeah, exactly so.


00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.240
- But that's the problem.


00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.720
You're not paying for a tool so it's like that.


00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.120
But they're very good because of how


00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.880
And diverse only 2% of open source contributions come from Africa.


00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880
Wow.


00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.520
So they may not be aware of this because they may not have community members complaining about this.


00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520
Exactly.


00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.160
So while it's 17% of the world population.


00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160
So that's a problem.


00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.160
Now that may change now because now there is a GitHub app for the first time.


00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.000
So it makes it much more easier for someone that doesn't have a computer but is the next generation


00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.400
And then the second half of the world going online is skipping laptops, skipping home


00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.440
internet, they're connecting via mobile devices.


00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:05.800
So now that there is a GitHub app that may evolve quicker or maybe not because again, so


00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.020
lower income countries mostly where people don't have time to do this and still there's


00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.240
problems like charging a cell phone, things like that are they going to spend that time.


00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.200
But if it's that percentage, they may just not know.


00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.160
So you have to inform.


00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.040
But that's the thing.


00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.560
You're getting something for free.


00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.080
You need to inform them what you want


00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.360
'cause they may or may not have a product backlog


00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.280
and they may not know what it is.


00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.880
You have less power because you're not a consumer,


00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.920
but you still have power.


00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.600
You just have to use your voice more.


00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.080
You may have more power because maybe people didn't say


00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.920
anything.


00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.440
It could be something they just really didn't know.


00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.760
- Yeah, yeah, that's true.


00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.320
I mean, I think that is something that maybe has mechanically


00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.600
and frequently can be more of is raising these issues,


00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.040
writing about it, and directly contacting the people.


00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.680
'Cause I, through all the years I've worked at Mozilla


00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.480
or worked as a contractor at Mozilla,


00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.480
I have built up relationships with some of the most well-known


00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.160
people in the open-source industry.


00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.760
So I do have connections.


00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.160
Yeah, but okay, I need to warn you, Mozilla is special.


00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.320
Mozilla is not the typical open source industry.


00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.120
It is the example people should follow from their most fast


00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.120
to everything with includes inclusion, not just,


00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.840
and I'm not just talking about the open source side,


00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.400
I'm also talking about the team side,


00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.000
their your ability to work from anywhere,


00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.560
you can work from home or in office or half and half,


00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.040
but we'll figure out where you get the money,


00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.120
things like that.


00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.320
They are an exemplary company.


00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.760
Are they the most successful financially though,


00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.000
as an open source back company?


00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.120
They have struggles, they've had a bunch of rounds


00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.440
of layoffs and things, so that's true.


00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.160
We must admit that they're not maybe the best business,


00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.400
but they're an exemplary way to do business ethically


00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.840
and to care for your community.


00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.680
But they invest a lot more in the community


00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.880
than pretty much almost any other open source project I know


00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.080
that isn't CNCF or maybe something red out open switch


00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.520
things like that where they're doing, but they started it.


00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.560
They really have been doing it for a lot longer.


00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.560
So I hate to admit that most open source communities


00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.640
are not going to be that way, but they should.


00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.400
- Yeah, no, I agree, no, I agree.


00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.400
And I'm just yesterday,


00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.000
Ms. Olob posted, Moxum posted the state of Ms. Olob


00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.080
and what's next.


00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.360
I think you should look that up.


00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.920
It's a very positive piece and I was glad to read that because I had my concerns to be honest.


00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.160
I'm from the financial perspective.


00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.240
Missilla has been fighting giants and it started to show.


00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:03.600
But I think there's a new found purpose to the company.


00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.840
Again, the inflection point I mentioned at the start.


00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:16.560
I think they've recognized it and I think they're embracing the challenge which I'm happy to see.


00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.560
I myself still need to read all the details but I kind of read the TLDR and it sounds really positive.


00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.880
And I like the fact that the foundation is driving a lot more of it again.


00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:34.880
Because I think, you know, they're the ones who's still squarely focused on the mission.


00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.600
The corporation sometimes needs to deviate from that a little bit to make the money to


00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.960
support the foundation so that they can do the work.


00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:55.000
And the thing is, inside Mozilla, there's a very open culture of voicing your opinion


00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.240
without fear of retaliation.


00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.720
And I think that is something that I, having worked that way, I can't see myself working


00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.080
any other way, so it'll just naturally be part of whatever I create.


00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:14.920
And for those listening, this is being recorded on Friday, November 18th, we are obviously thinking


00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.040
of this under the context of the recent Twitter acquisition. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the consequences


00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:26.600
choose specifically engineers for talking out publicly against, which also that's a difference


00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.080
though, speaking up in within a company, then speaking publicly. Yeah. There can be proper


00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:37.560
questions that doesn't mean people at Mozilla are talking shit externally. So I don't know if they


00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:44.120
would be legally covered or not. Yeah I don't know either. But I've seen people talking pretty


00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:50.920
openly about problems and I had while at Mozilla without me knowing that they were, that there was


00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:58.920
anything legally happening to them. But of course I know them not necessarily personally so what


00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.120
what happened to them.


00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.400
But with that say, there are the type of people who,


00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.440
if something that happened, they would not shy away


00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.920
from talking about it.


00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:14.640
- Hopefully nothing changes 'cause one leadership change,


00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.840
and that can be a big dramatic difference.


00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.600
We like to think that we have power, but.


00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.760
- No, no, no, that's very true.


00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.200
- For building our suddenly buys


00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.280
if not very profitable company, things can change.


00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.240
A centipilion error, I think.


00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.080
Yeah.


00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:35.000
Yeah, so that is interesting that you brought up that topic.


00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.240
I think before we dig into that,


00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.840
I just wanted like cycle back something else.


00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.640
So the changes that you envision,


00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.120
like so you said like, you know,


00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.800
companies should be more open to like sponsoring,


00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.720
to encouraging contributions.


00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.560
But do you?


00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.920
- If there been a firm technology,


00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.080
they are doing an actual risk to their bottom line


00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.040
and their company and their customers and their data


00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:04.040
because that's what it comes down to a lot when something happens by not investing in their staff contributing to it.


00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:25.440
Like, this is how there can be larger sponsorship, there can be conferences, there can be et cetera, but just paying staffers to be contributors is a wonderful simple way to give back to a community that someone at least half time is focused on adding that or a documentarian or whatever it is.


00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.280
like that is a logical way.


00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.640
That is something out of my hands.


00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.640
But there are a lot of things that happen


00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.760
in the severely distributed.


00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.800
It's one of the first remote communities.


00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.440
Most open source projects are the most distributed


00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.440
community is a lot that people get away with.


00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.560
Harassment, gatekeeping, saying, oh, that's easy.


00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.280
You can do that.


00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.840
That doesn't help anybody.


00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.960
having guidelines for how to speak to people,


00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.040
having a code of conduct,


00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.740
reminding people of the code of conduct,


00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.480
making them read it before they join,


00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.600
then actually having a way to enforce a code of conduct.


00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.360
I do be through the new stack.


00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.280
I do a lot of coverage of CoupCon and CNCF stuff,


00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.720
but be the first to use as an example.


00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.040
Maybe it's two years ago now,


00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.960
'cause what is time for those times?


00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.720
- Yeah. - I mean, this big deal.


00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:31.120
There was an asshole white supremacist tweeting white supremacist stuff and they banned him from one of the cube con events.


00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:42.400
Okay, yeah, that's great. They made a big example of it. Oh, look how great we are. But at that same event. I think so this must be like three years. It was back when they were in person before they went online. Now they're in person again.


00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.880
I personally need four women that group to act cube con events.


00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.320
- I can't leave this stuff.


00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.920
- So they did one thing once.


00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.760
- Yeah.


00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.880
- Who gives a thought?


00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.920
Like yeah, it's important to destroy what's a premises,


00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.320
but guess what?


00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.400
There's a lot more things you could do as well.


00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.920
So you need to have an enforceable code of conduct.


00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.160
You need to create examples of people if you need to.


00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.160
You need to take receipts.


00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.400
You need to then communicate with other communities


00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.120
and find ways that they know that's,


00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.080
'cause predatory people will just move


00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.560
follow and do the same pattern in another community. So people need to be aware of it.


00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:25.000
You need to take care of people who need to provide them basic human rights


00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.960
if they're especially giving you free work, but they're doing anything.


00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.400
You just need to treat people well.


00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.960
Yeah, enough for sure. No, I agree. Do you think a lot of this, or some of this,


00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.520
can be driven from a cross-reach level? What does it have to come from?


00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:47.520
- No, there are certain things that have to come, not from the company, but from the open source leadership.


00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.520
I'm not saying they're paid half of, what is it? 25, I probably butchering this.


00:35:53.520 --> 00:36:01.520
More than half of open source maintainers make $1,000 a month or less all the way down to zero.


00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:08.520
So these are people doing open source maintainers are overworked and overworked and underpaid.


00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:15.600
which again, if people are, if companies are investing in it, maybe hire that person and pay them to do that.


00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:22.280
Pay someone to run the community. If you are a company that even is investing in the engineering or is


00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.440
reliant on that, but something happens really bad at that company, it looks bad on you. Also, if this,


00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:34.240
and then from a business side, if the security is not taking care of things like that, like you can't do that.


00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.000
So, grassroots, these are code of conduct.


00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
That's something that is a requirement, like a check mark for women, even with enforcement


00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.600
and all, to then go ahead and to even join.


00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.080
So I think that needs to come from leadership and then it needs to be a priority, enforceable


00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080
code of conduct.


00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.560
You need because there are certain things like saying who is the person that you contact


00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.560
for stuff like that.


00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:10.000
code of conduct is a feature within GitHub. I know GitHub is not the only way, but it's like 80%.


00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.080
I'm sure that takes someone that administrative level to add that, things like that, but that


00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.480
doesn't mean some of the community can't say, "Hey, can I do this? Can I help you with this?"


00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.600
Anyone in a community can volunteer to do these things. One of the other problems that communities


00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.560
have is they don't have a pathway to leadership. They don't have a clear pathway to leadership,


00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:42.800
which is very important because you cannot stress. Maintainers are overworked and underpaid. So


00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:52.000
how can they do that? I'm trying to find right now there's some really great metrics coming out


00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.960
from the chaos community and others that the Linux Foundation and Qcon is trying to do. So like


00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.120
when you're talking about a different basic level to have a code of conduct maybe turning on


00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.360
closed captioning during meetings, the next level is publishing documentation and then having


00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:20.080
a contributor ladder. The next level is being transparent like you said being open and honest about


00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:26.720
how issues are picked up. One of obviously if you're the first time there are drive-through


00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:33.120
contributors and you're contributing for the first time and someone rejects your PR without


00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:40.720
telling you why, you're probably not coming back. Statistically, we need more studies like this,


00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:49.680
this is a 2017 study, but I see no reason for it to be different. Unless a woman is a very


00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:55.680
well-known contributor like you know leadership or maintainer level in all in a community or really well-known.


00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:13.680
She is less likely for her pull request to be accepted. If these names are blinded or masked to get rid of the gender, a woman is more likely to be accepted, which I'm sure their code is better because we are sexual socialized to perfection.


00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.280
perfection. It's same in the statistic that a woman will only apply for a job if she


00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.080
meets 100% of the requirements, which we know job descriptions or bullshit, but a man will


00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:30.560
at 65% again, just on the binary. Similarly, a woman I think would just be statistically more


00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:38.000
likely to be submitting code that is much better, things like that. So knowing that, having some sort


00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.440
of flagging system to make it easier for newcomers to understand where to go, but not just


00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.400
new, maybe their newcomers to your community, but they're


00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.040
entering your project and they're like hardcore GitHub contributors.


00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.760
So there's a new project in academia right now, but hopefully


00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.760
we'll see the crossover, which comes is looking to automatically


00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:10.480
flag issues and pair them with people based on their history


00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.240
of contribution on GitHub over.


00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:18.860
That's interesting. That would be a way to automate that. So there are ways to automate as well. So there's a lot of stuff. It's


00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.300
Fabio


00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.420
Of course, I believe this is coming out of there


00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:28.100
That is the head of that project is coming out of the to-do group. I need chance or is it separate?


00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:34.800
No, this is this is an academic who went on his own to do so now the next chance is


00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.040
Partner academia. This is a constant problem that academia partner


00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:46.760
AI, Deblonic tends to be a bit better than anything else, but you know, the next step, but he's


00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.720
applied to give a talk of CoupCon, so hopefully he'll get that talk now. I encourage him because


00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.680
so he can share his research and all to take to the next level of scale. Yeah, that sounds pretty


00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.760
interesting. Yeah, that sounds pretty good. Something you mentioned earlier that had me thinking,


00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:07.320
you were talking about somebody trying to fork something because it was in Russia or something.


00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:12.840
That there was a huge pressure. This last February March for GitHub to ban Russian projects.


00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which I don't think they did. And they did not touch that one. Yeah.


00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:24.200
But there was definitely a pressure to that. But imagine people that are reliant on that code.


00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:30.200
Imagine there's ethics around it should it happen or not. And also when you cut off,


00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.640
I mean, let's call Russia as continent.


00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.360
when you cut that off, how are they getting access to people outside when you live under a dictator


00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:45.240
regime? So there's a positive and negative to everything. And open source just reflects


00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:54.760
society more because of its on-duckness. Yeah, yeah, that's a complicated one because often the people


00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:03.960
writing that software is not for what's going on in Ukraine. And therefore, they're being


00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.720
punished for living in a country that they don't necessarily agree with what's happening.


00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.840
I mean, there's a lot of stuff. But it's still a form of sanction. No, it is.


00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.560
Can sanctions work with our Megalomania? Yeah.


00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:21.400
Dictator, we don't know, but in general, sanctions should logically work, but it could be deemed


00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:30.360
dissanctioned. But can corporations now Microsoft own and get up? Can Microsoft have the power of


00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.080
of a country to sanction either.


00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.120
So there's that question as well.


00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.560
GitHub, we look at it as like,


00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.640
it is on my Microsoft, Simon LinkedIn.


00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.200
- Yeah, yeah.


00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.880
And a few years ago, I would,


00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.960
I have not had like that,


00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.580
but Microsoft has turned around, big time.


00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.840
I just constantly see.


00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.440
- Certainly for green.


00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.560
- Yeah, I see so many good things coming out of them


00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.760
and they're doing so much for


00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:07.840
accessibility is incredible. Just yesterday, I noticed they have the ability and teams to have


00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:14.480
sign language interpreters join your team's meetings. I mean it's such an obvious thing but


00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:24.880
you know, yet they are the first to do it. And then I saw that whole range of gadgetry that they have


00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.640
with the buttons and the joysticks that you can turn around and use it to


00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.840
achieve. And it's all the parts can be into change to, you know, make it for


00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.000
just your need. It's just incredible. And this is the benefit of having diverse


00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.560
engineers on your team and user testing, but that can only come. The UK government,


00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:53.920
the UK government, a hot mask. UK government digital service is very impressive.


00:43:53.920 --> 00:44:01.920
It is extremely accessible because they started from the start. There are no edge cases. If everything is going paperless,


00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.920
there are no edge cases. Everyone has to use it. And part of what they did was from the start, they hired blind developers and


00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:21.920
different developers with one arm or different disabilities. Because guess what? Those are people who are neurodiverse, who are much more likely both all of these groups are


00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:28.260
tend to be have higher levels of unemployment significantly higher. But guess what?


00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.520
So you're doing a good thing, but also you're making a better project. And that's why open


00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.880
source means, well, the source reflection of the world. That's why everything needs. But my


00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.900
constant mantra is, if tech is the future, and open source is the backbone of the future,


00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:51.600
because we're talking like 70% of businesses, jardeef code, things like that. Who is participating


00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.320
and building in that future. And how are we damaging that future by blocking people from participating?


00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.880
Yeah. That's my mantra. Yeah, yeah, I know for sure. In various words. Yeah, I know for sure.


00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:07.680
So you also wrote a piece in that, you know, obviously it's very well-timed now with what's


00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:17.920
happening in tech fear and layoffs. It's massive. And it's interesting, I think it's the ex.


00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.800
No, sir, am I writing it?


00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:26.960
And so the X, I think it's the XCO of GitHub that said,


00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.240
all these companies know they're overstaffed,


00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.240
and they've just not acknowledged it.


00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:36.000
And now they're being hit with all these,


00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.520
the climate of economic climate,


00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.800
and they now have to acknowledge that they have flown


00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.160
too high for too long.


00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.640
- Okay, first we're not gonna talk about Twitter


00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.160
because that is a different generation.


00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.760
And that is an-- - Completely different.


00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.040
- That doesn't make sense.


00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.040
But L'Arthacal, who's someone I interviewed for the article,


00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.920
someone that does is like an engineering leadership coach,


00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.280
she said the truth is these companies are making up


00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.440
that they could have laid off zero people


00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.920
and it wouldn't have had an impact.


00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.920
So this is, the companies that are doing this,


00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.040
Besides like a Peloton, which kind of like lost its way post COVID.


00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.400
And I don't think anyone was shot like we feel bad for the people.


00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.000
And besides maybe Salesforce.com, we don't know,


00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.760
but they were probably doing the same.


00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.760
These giant companies that are doing layoffs right now,


00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:38.760
meta or blot were doing hiring freezes, Microsoft, etc.


00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.240
were hiring because they could.


00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:48.160
There was time six months ago, even, where they had the money.


00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.620
It's like, let's just all fight over developers.


00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:55.320
Let's just fight over engineers and let's pay them six figure bonuses,


00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.380
which good for those people that got those roles,


00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.840
but then first last hard, first fire.


00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.600
>> Mm-hm.


00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.560
>> But it was irresponsible and it was capitalism.


00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.320
That's what it was.


00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.480
They had the money to compete and they won't.


00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.000
Do I think overall this is where it's going?


00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.320
I don't think.


00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.480
So in tech, I think overall we are,


00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.080
it's quite clear we're entering recession.


00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.240
It was an irresponsible, like I can do it,


00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.640
so I'm gonna compete and do it.


00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.960
And hopefully those people had savings


00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.880
that had those jobs, things like that.


00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.480
But also the truth of the matter is,


00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.360
none of these companies, they're doing it for stock


00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.200
and margins and boards and things that are so separated


00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.880
from the human being.


00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.520
But it's basically its capitalism.


00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.440
So that's the fucked up system we agreed to participate in.


00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.700
So it's not great.


00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.660
I feel bad for the individuals and their families,


00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.520
but--


00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.720
And especially when we're talking about,


00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.640
we forget contract workers will be cut


00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.740
so that security guards, cleaners for buildings,


00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.380
cafeteria workers, because we know Facebook


00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.120
or whatever we want to call these days,


00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.960
famously has food, all these companies,


00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:03.800
that food, things like that.


00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.960
Those are the things being cut as well.


00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.680
And nobody's talking about the workers


00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.680
and those are the workers that will be screwed.


00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.560
These are also the workers at least in the US


00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.920
that are mobilizing a lot and unionizing,


00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.920
so maybe not.


00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:20.400
I believe Metas or Facebook, Papakaria workers


00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.800
were some of the first tech unions,


00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.280
so we'll see maybe they're okay.


00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:29.280
But it's just, it was a downer of a week last week.


00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.640
Let's be honest, because there were just layoff after layoff


00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.520
it felt like a blood bath,


00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:44.480
But it's just, typically they have contracts in California or Europe where they have some


00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.800
sort of job security at least to get severance and things and hopefully they can get their


00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.800
next job.


00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.000
They just need to figure out how to go about that.


00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.480
It's harder also for people that are like left behind at a company in the back.


00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480
So just sucks.


00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.720
So they're also planning their move.


00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.200
So there will be tons of moves in tech in the next couple months.


00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.160
Maybe the wait till January, February, but yeah.


00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.000
- It's okay.


00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.120
- So there will be many things.


00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.120
There's still a lot in demand and things.


00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.400
It's just more worrying when,


00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.760
like a Twitter I know he said,


00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.680
"Let's not talk about it,"


00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.960
but when he fires his entire ethical team,


00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.280
which Twitter was a standout with that.


00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.840
They were at least very transparent


00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.200
and much more than any other algorithms we see


00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.760
at the big fan companies and things like that.


00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.680
Or whatever we call, I guess,


00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.120
is not faying anymore 'cause they've all changed their names.


00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.160
So I don't know what the acronym is now.


00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:41.160
But yeah, so it's just wearing when that happened four days before an election, he fires most


00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.360
of his content moderators things like that.


00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.440
So we just, his companies are bigger than countries.


00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:55.760
So they're the ones, but SMBs are still growing like 12% because they're used to being,


00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:01.520
you know, more frugal and, you know, growing, but they're growing slowly, not growing dramatically.


00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.080
They're not being irresponsible.


00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.480
B2B seems to be doing well.


00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.600
Salesforce is the only one that of the big B2B,


00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.040
maybe you call straight B2B,


00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.080
they had a big layoff too,


00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.880
but it's mostly B2C.


00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.760
Advertising is getting less.


00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.320
I don't know if that will make the internet better


00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.880
for everyone or not.


00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.440
Like that's the first marketing is always first thing cut.


00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.920
Community dev realm, this is gonna affect,


00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.400
bringing it back to open source.


00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.800
DevRel is one of the hardest jobs to measure.


00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.840
So they often get, I just did across across my neck,


00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.680
but it's podcast.


00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.320
So I should probably say that I did a very able assemble


00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.520
that I shouldn't have done either.


00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.960
They get cut by I shouldn't have done it either.


00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.920
Yeah, it's a weird time right now.


00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.080
No, that's true.


00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.160
But--


00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:57.200
So we touched on accessibility earlier


00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.640
and about the fact that something like the GitHub app


00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:07.440
potentially being able to include more people.


00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:13.440
And I mean, like for me, I can talk to some of this as well.


00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:19.640
In South Africa, we are energy grid is severely constrained.


00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.560
It's severely mismanaged and fraught with corruption.


00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.260
As a result, we have these things, it's called load shitting over here, but I think people


00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.920
know it as rolling blackouts, but it basically means that they're spurious during the day


00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.880
where your power is just cut.


00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:43.640
And depending on the stage, these different stages goes from 1 to 8.


00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:50.040
You have more power cuts or less power cuts and they lost for a longer period of time.


00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:57.960
Now the effect of that is multiple to small businesses, especially businesses in Massive,


00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.400
there's a huge impact, small businesses are closing because they can operate when the


00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:09.040
power is out and then they lose customers, but they still have to pay their rent at the


00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.560
end of the month and they still have to pay their tax at the end of the month, even though


00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.560
that text is supposed to go to maintain this darn


00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.560
infrastructure. But


00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.560
so


00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.560
and the thing is one of the things that I've noticed is so


00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.560
on a good day like right now when we're having a conversation and we have


00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.560
electricity, I have a 5G connection and it's good. And


00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.560
I the internet is constantly topping and I can have a video call and everything is good and


00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:44.320
is good and you know it's not constantly buffering and breaking up. But when that's not the case,


00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:54.160
sometimes I use my phone as a hotspot, but sometimes it drops to 3G. And for people with


00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:01.600
3G access on a phone, the internet essentially does not exist. Well, as we are privileged to know


00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.440
it nowadays, but yeah. So how we ur up with our all up basically is what you're going back to.


00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:18.440
Yeah, and I think it's, I think it's largely due. And I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm guilty of it as well, even though I'm more aware of it, then most.


00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:31.440
But a lot of the products are built by folks on the latest Macbooks using, you know, super fast fiber and they aren't thinking.


00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:39.680
Yes, this is oh, I see where you're going. Yes, that open source and the world of tech is screwed if they don't have people


00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:49.680
You know on poor internet with shitty devices flip phones or both now they're back or something. Yeah, but yeah, that is true too


00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.080
Yeah, you need you need people involved also


00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:59.100
By having the world involved you have much more easier 24 hour customer support or user support


00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.080
There's always a business benefit and you could bring on so whoever cracks that


00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.680
Is going to be the winner?


00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:14.040
So the people that bring the next people online that was something that Mark Zuckerberg was really into for a while


00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:21.140
But I haven't heard anything about it for a while his internet start up and trying to bring people online would like balloon to internet and


00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.840
Africa and things but


00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:29.880
It's definitely important because the internet saves lives. It provides medical training. It helps farmers understand


00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:34.820
How to get rid get a better crop yield and be safer. Yeah, yeah, yeah


00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.440
supports democracy


00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.440
Yeah, if it's not controlled


00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.640
actually for sure for sure


00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.160
Yeah, there's so much more that we can talk about bad I know we're time constraints so


00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.200
In closing


00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:56.560
choose dance. One thing, what do you love and what are your hopes for the future?


00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:08.960
About open source. Okay. Well, I just love the communities. I've been so many. And so I love


00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:15.360
that aspect. I love that I've had this privilege through it to tell these stories and to mentors,


00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.520
some university students over the last couple months about diversity, inclusion, and open source.


00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.120
And I hope it just does better because you all need to do better.


00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.720
So and out.


00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.960
That's my final line.


00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.840
You can connect with me on at Jemke Riggins on places.


00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.080
I don't know if those places will exist by the time this publisher.


00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.440
But yeah, so thank you so much for inviting me on this conversation.


00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.560
