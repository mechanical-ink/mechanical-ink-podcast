Welcome to the Mechanical Inc podcast, a collection of conversations about the open-source ecosystem.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We speak with containers and companies that play a key role in ensuring the health and sustainability of open-source today and in the future.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey Jennifer, thanks for joining me on the Mechanical Inc podcast.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So how are you today? How has life treating you?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,160
I mean, it's Friday, so it should be a relaxing moment, but usually it's a, okay, you've got to get

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,040
shit done for the rest of the week moment, but that's going to have to be here.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah, yeah, same here. So I learned about you through a colleague at a client I work with

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:56,360
Mazzala and specifically the Indian WebDocs team. She's called Ruth John. She kind of knows you

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,600
from my dad understand. Maybe she knows of your work. Maybe she doesn't know you personally,

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,120
but she shared an article you wrote about what the fuck is wrong with open source communities.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,200
That's a good read. Let me read that. The funny thing is it's interesting to me from a different

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,120
perspective. It's a different couple of perspectives. So let me lay those off on the table. So

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,600
I run a company called Mechanical Inc. It's been a company for a long time just as a way from

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:38,600
me to work with international clients. But I didn't really have a, I don't really think about what

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,720
I wanted to do with it. But over the years I started feeling more and more like maybe I should do

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,880
something with this instead of just, you know, working for somebody maybe there's something useful

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,040
like and do because for me, I want the work that I do to be meaningful and impactful as

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,920
much as possible.

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,560
And so I try to find people and clients that I can work with that has a mission that I

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
can believe in.

21
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,240
And that's one of the reasons I started contracting with Mozilla way back in the day.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,480
But in the last year, I found what I wanted to do with Mechanical Inc.

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,800
And that is for it to be an open source company that focuses on the open social ecosystem,

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000
but then also a civic and ethical tech.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,960
Because I think we're in an inflection point when it comes to tech in general.

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,560
Some of it is painful for a lot of people, some of it is necessary evil.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,800
And some things have just been let go without too much constraint being put on it.

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,480
And so yeah, I don't want to do another agency building websites for other people.

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,640
What I do meaningful work.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,960
But then on the mesilocyte, I was part of the MDN WebDogs project, which is a massive

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,360
open source project.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,680
And I love what it stands for and what it does and the opportunities for people to learn

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,520
how to make websites in a way that's easily accessible, that's free and all that kind of stuff,

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:22,360
and be able to contribute back to it. And so in April this year, I smit from being the

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,840
front-end engineer on the project to being the community manager for WebDocs. And that is where

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,560
I started digging into the community aspects more and more and more. I kind of always did it,

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,960
than that's why I was the natural choice and we started looking for somebody.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,280
But now having done it for a while I've been digging into all the things and I've

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,600
realized some of these problems that I wasn't entirely aware of. Some of them are wise,

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,840
some of them are wise. So that is why that article was very

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,160
well-timed for me because I was starting to feel that

42
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,880
WTF feelings and so when that came across by path I was like this is the perfect

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,200
combination of things. Me finding my way with the company, what I do in Mozilla and this article

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,680
you've written and I was like I have to speak to you. So that is a very long way, I'll tell you how

45
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:32,040
we got to today. So I think with all of that said I'm going to shut up and then I'm going to...

46
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Well, I have a question for you.

47
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Shoot.

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Because you said something that is a bit contradictory,

49
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
or maybe as an oxymoron.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
OK.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
You said you wanted to be an open source company.

52
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
What do you think that is?

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
And what does that mean?

54
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,640
So it's a combination of things for me personally.

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,440
So other than being an open source company,

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
it's also a open startup.

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,440
So that means everything we do is transparent.

58
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
That includes salaries, that includes our expenses,

59
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
that includes any income, regenerate profits we make.

60
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,920
All of that I'm busy. So for the longest time, the company also did no website.

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,920
It does have a website now and I'm currently working on the /Open page,

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,560
which is where you share all these statistics. And that includes

63
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,880
Harby approach hiring, for example. I hate this idea that because you live in India,

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,000
you get paid a quarter of the salary of some of you who lives in the Bay Area.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,640
And I know it's, there's a happy middle ground you need to find.

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,960
Because, you know, as a company that runs in South Africa, I also only have the

67
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,040
monetary capabilities that I have as a company in Africa.

68
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,400
But I don't want to use those salary scales.

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Like when I employ, I want to employ with what's fair for the work you do,

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
not where you live.

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
So that plays into it.

72
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,240
So you're an ethical company.

73
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,960
You're a transparent company.

74
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,920
I don't think you are in an open source company.

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,440
You are an open company.

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,560
You're a transparent ethical.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
These are all great things.

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,960
I would say as an intro to those that maybe are less familiar with open source

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
or haven't thought of it as a business,

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,920
open source is not a business model.

81
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,160
Because open source inherently, you are licensed,

82
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360
open source is a community,

83
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,400
but it is hard is the open source software,

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,560
which means, or can be open license,

85
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
creative comments, images,

86
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,960
any creative work that creative workers are doing.

87
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,440
And, but you are, if you're doing a true open source license,

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,360
not some MongoDB stuff, things like that,

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,980
You are saying that anyone can use your code, including to profit off of, including for

90
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:09,740
unethical reasons, including to build a website that spreads hate speech, things like that.

91
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,340
So I'm arguing you are not open source company.

92
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,020
You are a company that maybe utilizes open source tools, participates in open source

93
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:26,900
communities, maybe consults open source communities. And you strive to be transparent and ethical,

94
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,740
but I would say, and this is the problem with open source. So open source as a whole,

95
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,260
and it's interesting because this isn't something I discussed in that article, but then someone

96
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,540
brilliantly responded to my article in a comment and discussed it. And this is very true.

97
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,780
Open source is a great thing in some ways, but is inherently flawed, which leads to inherent

98
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,580
huge problems with diversity, equity, and inclusion, belonging, as it were, because it is based

99
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,660
on voluntary work. And who already does more than three-quarters of the voluntary care work in the

100
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,020
world, women, and people of color, etc. As you grow into the intersectionalism, these are more marginalized

101
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,580
people, people marginalized by tech, not by themselves tech is marginalizing them. So what's happening is

102
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:24,660
tech as a whole somewhere in between 20 and there are many problems with diversity and tech. It's

103
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,900
easiest to talk along the binary because that is typically what most companies and specifically open

104
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,740
source companies and open source surveys are targeting. Typically they can do they're doing

105
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:46,260
the binary and where people are. So that means tech in general we're talking about

106
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:55,140
20 to 23, 24 percent women. And that's across the board at least for graduating from Qtor Science

107
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:02,660
degree. When you talk about open stores, yes, the Google Summer of Code and all these fantastic

108
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,380
programs that are these internships that are really positive, maybe are about that. Maybe

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:15,780
do have like a 23% women participants. But as you go along, you have, I'm trying to remember

110
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,020
my friend Bianca, my friend in the world of tech called it a I'm going to look it up because it's

111
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,380
a word I hadn't heard before, but she I think coined Bianca Trinkenreich coined the term.

112
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:37,140
It's right there. I will find it. But basically people leak. So we're we're ending up with maybe

113
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:45,060
be three to 4% women and non-binary people contributing to the tech community.

114
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,580
Now, the New Linux Foundation Survey of Diversity Acquing Inclusion last year was up there

115
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,220
at like 14%, which is mind-boggling compared to any other surveys.

116
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,460
So I really need to dive into their statistics and everything.

117
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,740
But there's a leak and it doesn't just usually, when it's in open source, it doesn't

118
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,240
usually just affects the individual open source community.

119
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,020
It affects the whole open source community

120
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,220
'cause people are less likely to,

121
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,360
if, and then it affects the tech community

122
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,200
because women are much more likely

123
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,460
and people might not be sure

124
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,860
are eyes by tech and the world are more likely to quit tech.

125
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
So they invest in all that time and energy

126
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,640
learning with this girls set and then they quit

127
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,940
because they feel ostracized and stuff.

128
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,940
So that's a long way around to say,

129
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,060
I think you can have a resource mindset.

130
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,540
You can have an open mindset, you can return to transparency,

131
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,580
but I don't think you are technically an open source company

132
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,740
because open source is still defined inherently

133
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,100
in that license.

134
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,060
So if everything you're doing was licensed under MIT license

135
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,780
or one of these licenses, it could be.

136
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,260
And there's such a thing as an open source mindset

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,060
for better, for worse, things like that.

138
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,020
that there inherently can't really be a business

139
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,820
around open source.

140
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,700
You can build a business, an abstraction layer on top

141
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,380
of open source because open source

142
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,780
is inherently more complex code.

143
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,740
And you can find a way to make it simpler

144
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,220
and provide a service.

145
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,860
But you're not open source then,

146
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,020
you're proprietary on top of open source things like that.

147
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,660
Now it's a tricky thing.

148
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,780
So open source is a very odd duck.

149
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,860
And because it still relies on volunteer work ends

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,380
or companies that the larger projects are sponsoring it

151
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,460
and then paying their developers, their engineers,

152
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,620
their even marketers, community management people

153
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,140
as their day job to contribute to it is the other way

154
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,140
And then we know the largest companies in tech

155
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,740
and in the world also have diversity,

156
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,820
equity inclusion problems.

157
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,700
So it's a full cycle.

158
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,060
So those are the two ways most people are coming across.

159
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,060
So like in 2020, there was a huge up increase

160
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,140
and it's wonderful in that way of people contributing

161
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,140
to open source because they were bored.

162
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,900
(laughing)

163
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,380
And that's a great way to, and there was a downturn

164
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,500
the economies of some people who are losing jobs, but they're also, they had all this time

165
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,020
on their hands to make bread and to contribute to open source. It's a great way to get

166
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:37,740
example of work and to contribute to a community and get a network. So you get proof of work

167
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,700
and you have a network. But who whose lives got harder when schools were closed? Full

168
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,420
circle again. I'm sure if we look at the statistics. Parents but mostly women

169
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,180
were not able to contribute more. People of color who are more likely to be

170
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,860
taken care of older or disabled relatives, statistically much more likely to

171
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,860
be living in intergenerational households. Not able to. Those that can't afford to

172
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,380
have internet when they're working from home or don't have a place that they

173
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:30,380
can have background because member of virtual backgrounds didn't work for black people for months on zoom because they would just be head them. So there was just a whole cycle of different problems with that so open sources of reflection of problems of society.

174
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:39,380
It can be a great thing, but it can also be a mess because you can have hundreds of thousands of people in a community and it can tend to be.

175
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:53,260
more of the free fraud. Yeah, yeah. So, okay, that's interesting. So, you cannot truly be an

176
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,660
open-source business because if that's the case then you need to be kind of like a nonprofit,

177
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:07,100
right? That's the only feasible way of being a truly open-source company. If you are not,

178
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,020
So your code is all freely available.

179
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:19,180
And then you stack ethics on top of that to, in an attempt, to try and prevent people from using

180
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:28,940
your software for nefarious purposes. There is a new license coming about, about that,

181
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,700
an ethical use license, because I think that is the only fair situation. And that's happened

182
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,740
Google like they had walkouts and all but they're AI there a lot of Google is open source a lot I

183
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:49,660
Android Kubernetes these all came out of there but they were getting contracts with the US government

184
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:58,140
guess US government spends money on tech with only really on defense the rest of it is pretty

185
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:14,140
So, and people walked out and things. So that is something that's happening with like open source tooling WordPress WordPress is a business that provides templates and things but it is also an open source company.

186
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:23,140
or not company. It's an open source product. It is a company that is the main sponsor of an open source product.

187
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,140
And it sells things, but you can also get a WordPress site for free.

188
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,140
It does definitely have less value for an SEO perspective and things like that.

189
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:40,140
For speed things like that, but you can still do it. Anyone can spin one up, can fork it.

190
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,740
But yeah, that's how that works.

191
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,140
You, but they still can't restrict.

192
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,740
What you use it for as the free use case.

193
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,040
If someone used it to build an anti trans troll farm.

194
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,340
They can't restrict that use.

195
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
There are other ways people can put pressure on different things,

196
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,940
but.

197
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,740
That they can't and still be considered open source,

198
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,840
but there is talk of a new ethical open source license.

199
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I don't know where that is. I'm very excited for it because I think that is a problem.

200
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,120
Yeah, and I mean, too, that sounds really good. I would like to support that.

201
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,520
I'll definitely do some research and try and find one information about it.

202
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,240
So how would you rephrase the, I don't know, how you would call yourself? So if you would say,

203
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,800
like, I'm an open source company that's also into ethical and civic tech. I was like, oh,

204
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,800
but an open source company, it's not quite accurate. How would you rephrase that?

205
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,360
open source friendly. I mean everything we bold is open source and you can use it for whatever

206
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,640
nefarious reasons but we would like you not to do that but of course we can restrict you from

207
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:58,640
doing that. Currently at least hopefully this licensing as a way of enabling us to do that,

208
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,400
it's going to be hard, it's going to be legal, legal easy, it's going to have to play a role there

209
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,280
and that's expensive. Also participating in creating the code. That's another thing who is seeing

210
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,560
the roadmap. This is what comes up. MongoDB, I'm not trying to be harsh on them. I'm not a data

211
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,560
scientist. I don't, I've never even forked anything. So I'm not, I don't tack, I write about tack,

212
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,160
but they're always the example. They created their own air quotes, open source license.

213
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:38,480
From other reasons than anything else, like outside pull requests do not get accepted. They

214
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,760
keep everything locking key. It's like at least 98% of the code is written with by staffers for MongoDB.

215
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:55,760
They don't publish a roadmap. So when updates come out, it's kind of like, oh wow, look,

216
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,800
which has happened. No one knew it was coming, things like that. But they are a successful business.

217
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:11,280
They are publicly traded. Like they do have the ability to... I don't... they can't be under

218
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,080
open source and I have not read their license details to understand, but maybe they... under

219
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,600
their license could stop because of use of summaries and they tried to... yeah, but there are still

220
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,400
companies like Perkona building on top of it to try to abstract complexity and things and they

221
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,480
then market themselves as this alternative and the ethical open source. So it's spinning something.

222
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,280
But I mean, you can be have open source in your mindset and all. I just don't think you're

223
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,200
a company or an open source business. Open source is a mindset and especially it's a community.

224
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:00,240
So you and on the other hand, there are tons of proprietary software that have created wonderful communities as well.

225
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:18,240
And Slack is a great use for all of those Slack works, whether you're a little company, you're a bunch of, you're trying to crowdsource even though you're not open source, you're trying to crowdsource technical support or support or you're trying to build this whole enriched community around open source.

226
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Yeah.

227
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
I know.

228
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Yeah.

229
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
So interesting.

230
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,320
So yeah, I think one of the example examples of that

231
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,560
nefarious use is what happened with audacity.

232
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,320
So audacity is open source.

233
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,160
It's probably was the most popular open source audio

234
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,720
editing tool.

235
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,160
And then it was purchased by another company

236
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,960
and injected full of spyware more wear.

237
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,120
And your data ended up being sent back to headquarters

238
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,040
located in Russia.

239
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,040
And so, but thankfully there was a moment in time

240
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,520
where people could forget before that change happened.

241
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:13,720
And there's one or two variants now of audacity around.

242
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,120
But of course, somehow, I don't know,

243
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,260
some other community that was involved with Odacity

244
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,920
just left instead of moving to these new forks,

245
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,720
which is interesting,

246
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
'cause David's also talked a while ago

247
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,520
about forking WordPress.

248
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,680
I don't know if that ever happened,

249
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,640
but this was like during the Grittenberg stage,

250
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
where I was switching everything to Grittenberg

251
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,160
and like the accessibility of WordPress's admin

252
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,160
stuff degraded quite a bit and then there was this thing but I think people in

253
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:55,200
learnt that there's an an error problem in forking WordPress in that you by doing that you

254
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:06,320
you also inherit all the technical debt. I heard that from the the due to bulk ghost which is

255
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,920
also an open source project that a company is built on top of which is kind of like a blogging

256
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,520
platform it started or focused on journalists journalism but now it's more a way of

257
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,080
generally just being able to make money from your own content. You can host yourself, you can

258
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,200
host it on their cloud servers, they have like striped integration all that kind of stuff. I have

259
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,040
an issue with the striped integration which we can maybe dig into a little bit because it

260
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:41,280
it plays into the exclusionary nature of some of these things but they so the person who started

261
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:52,160
ghost. He was the lead UX person at WordPress. And so he's first inclination when he got

262
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,320
the idea for ghost was to fork WordPress. But then that same thing came up. It's like,

263
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,840
now you're inherently inheriting all the problems of WordPress. So first, before you can do anything

264
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,680
innovative, you have to step back and solve all the bad things that you don't like or that's broken

265
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,680
or they just need fixing or it's a massive.

266
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,080
And then you have to open source that.

267
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,000
You have to open source that.

268
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,960
So then they could fork it back or something.

269
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,720
They can-- everyone benefits from it.

270
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,920
But do you-- are you comfortable with everyone benefiting

271
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,200
from it?

272
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,840
Are you comfortable with building a better WordPress

273
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,760
and then someone somehow making millions of dollars off of it?

274
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
Are you comfortable with you not getting any of that credit?

275
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,680
which is okay, some people are like that.

276
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,680
But then it depends on how big of a community is too.

277
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,160
So much of like the modern cloud native stack

278
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,800
has these pieces in it that are from a single maintainer.

279
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,200
Like a single person is maintaining,

280
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
single person maintains pearl.

281
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,240
Like, and they do it great, but in sales,

282
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,280
they always say hit by the bus,

283
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,440
but I heard a different last year's coupon,

284
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,800
which is what if someone wins the lottery suddenly?

285
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,920
Are they going to still continue maintaining it?

286
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,760
What if something happens to them, things like that?

287
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,160
There's a positive and negative to open source in every way.

288
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,520
But the only solution that is going forward right now

289
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,540
is to get more people involved and persuade more people,

290
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,000
persuade more companies, I guess,

291
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,040
if people can do it to invest in open source.

292
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,160
If you're using open source,

293
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,320
you should be investing in it.

294
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
You should be paying your staff to contribute to it.

295
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
But in the meantime the communities need to find a way to

296
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,760
motivate a

297
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
mostly voluntary community

298
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,800
like community leadership, but the community itself. So

299
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,340
Yeah, there's a couple of things I'm going to dig into there just just to like cycle back on the striped thing like

300
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,400
Oh, like I live in South Africa. So

301
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
and

302
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
for the entire African continent

303
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
Stripe is still not available.

304
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
Like I can pay somebody if you use Stripe,

305
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,080
but I can't use Stripe to accept money.

306
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Now, as a result, I have stumbled upon many things

307
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,960
like Substack, like Ghost Pro and other services

308
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,600
where it makes it possible for you to, for example,

309
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,840
create educational material in a nice environment

310
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,400
where it supports markdown, it supports embeds of video

311
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
of like little code snippets, code editors, all these things, which is super nice.

312
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,760
But then when you want to think about, okay, what can I do for a membership tier?

313
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:51,360
It says connect stripe and I'm like, I'd like to, but I can't. Then stripe has this thing called

314
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,680
stripe atlas, which allows you to incorporate as a company and Delaware in the United States.

315
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:06,320
but that costs $500 to start off with and then $100 per year to keep that going.

316
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,240
It goes to where of this? I'm sure they should be, but I was thinking of

317
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,520
you didn't say that yeah I would bring it to their attention they may not know and they may choose to

318
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,440
also integrate with another payment provider. That's the interesting thing. According to their

319
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,800
docs you could use PayPal but if I follow their docs and how it's supposed to work it doesn't

320
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
It doesn't align with the product.

321
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Part of the problem, docs are one of those things when you have a mostly volunteer community

322
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
or also at corporations.

323
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
These are something that the majority of engineers creating code don't have time or

324
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
energy or inclination to create an update docs.

325
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,800
So, and guess what? A lot of these different things need recognition too.

326
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,800
If you have an amazing docs person in your community, you need to recognize the

327
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,200
the fuck out of them if they are providing that sort of stuff.

328
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,160
So you as a community member need to report

329
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,160
or maybe you ask, why is this not working?

330
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,960
Figure out if they can fix it or you can fix it

331
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,400
and then you could contribute updating that documentation.

332
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,320
- Yeah, exactly so.

333
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,240
- But that's the problem.

334
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,720
You're not paying for a tool so it's like that.

335
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,120
But they're very good because of how

336
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,880
And diverse only 2% of open source contributions come from Africa.

337
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Wow.

338
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,520
So they may not be aware of this because they may not have community members complaining about this.

339
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Exactly.

340
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,160
So while it's 17% of the world population.

341
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
So that's a problem.

342
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Now that may change now because now there is a GitHub app for the first time.

343
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,000
So it makes it much more easier for someone that doesn't have a computer but is the next generation

344
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
And then the second half of the world going online is skipping laptops, skipping home

345
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,440
internet, they're connecting via mobile devices.

346
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,800
So now that there is a GitHub app that may evolve quicker or maybe not because again, so

347
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,020
lower income countries mostly where people don't have time to do this and still there's

348
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,240
problems like charging a cell phone, things like that are they going to spend that time.

349
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,200
But if it's that percentage, they may just not know.

350
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,160
So you have to inform.

351
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,040
But that's the thing.

352
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,560
You're getting something for free.

353
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,080
You need to inform them what you want

354
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,360
'cause they may or may not have a product backlog

355
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,280
and they may not know what it is.

356
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,880
You have less power because you're not a consumer,

357
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,920
but you still have power.

358
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
You just have to use your voice more.

359
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,080
You may have more power because maybe people didn't say

360
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,920
anything.

361
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,440
It could be something they just really didn't know.

362
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,760
- Yeah, yeah, that's true.

363
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,320
I mean, I think that is something that maybe has mechanically

364
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,600
and frequently can be more of is raising these issues,

365
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,040
writing about it, and directly contacting the people.

366
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,680
'Cause I, through all the years I've worked at Mozilla

367
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,480
or worked as a contractor at Mozilla,

368
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I have built up relationships with some of the most well-known

369
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,160
people in the open-source industry.

370
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,760
So I do have connections.

371
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah, but okay, I need to warn you, Mozilla is special.

372
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,320
Mozilla is not the typical open source industry.

373
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,120
It is the example people should follow from their most fast

374
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,120
to everything with includes inclusion, not just,

375
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,840
and I'm not just talking about the open source side,

376
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,400
I'm also talking about the team side,

377
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
their your ability to work from anywhere,

378
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,560
you can work from home or in office or half and half,

379
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,040
but we'll figure out where you get the money,

380
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,120
things like that.

381
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,320
They are an exemplary company.

382
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,760
Are they the most successful financially though,

383
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
as an open source back company?

384
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,120
They have struggles, they've had a bunch of rounds

385
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,440
of layoffs and things, so that's true.

386
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,160
We must admit that they're not maybe the best business,

387
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,400
but they're an exemplary way to do business ethically

388
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,840
and to care for your community.

389
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,680
But they invest a lot more in the community

390
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,880
than pretty much almost any other open source project I know

391
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,080
that isn't CNCF or maybe something red out open switch

392
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,520
things like that where they're doing, but they started it.

393
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,560
They really have been doing it for a lot longer.

394
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,560
So I hate to admit that most open source communities

395
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,640
are not going to be that way, but they should.

396
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,400
- Yeah, no, I agree, no, I agree.

397
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
And I'm just yesterday,

398
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,000
Ms. Olob posted, Moxum posted the state of Ms. Olob

399
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
and what's next.

400
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,360
I think you should look that up.

401
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,920
It's a very positive piece and I was glad to read that because I had my concerns to be honest.

402
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,160
I'm from the financial perspective.

403
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,240
Missilla has been fighting giants and it started to show.

404
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:03,600
But I think there's a new found purpose to the company.

405
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Again, the inflection point I mentioned at the start.

406
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:16,560
I think they've recognized it and I think they're embracing the challenge which I'm happy to see.

407
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I myself still need to read all the details but I kind of read the TLDR and it sounds really positive.

408
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,880
And I like the fact that the foundation is driving a lot more of it again.

409
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Because I think, you know, they're the ones who's still squarely focused on the mission.

410
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,600
The corporation sometimes needs to deviate from that a little bit to make the money to

411
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,960
support the foundation so that they can do the work.

412
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:55,000
And the thing is, inside Mozilla, there's a very open culture of voicing your opinion

413
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,240
without fear of retaliation.

414
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,720
And I think that is something that I, having worked that way, I can't see myself working

415
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,080
any other way, so it'll just naturally be part of whatever I create.

416
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,920
And for those listening, this is being recorded on Friday, November 18th, we are obviously thinking

417
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,040
of this under the context of the recent Twitter acquisition. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the consequences

418
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,600
choose specifically engineers for talking out publicly against, which also that's a difference

419
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,080
though, speaking up in within a company, then speaking publicly. Yeah. There can be proper

420
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,560
questions that doesn't mean people at Mozilla are talking shit externally. So I don't know if they

421
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,120
would be legally covered or not. Yeah I don't know either. But I've seen people talking pretty

422
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,920
openly about problems and I had while at Mozilla without me knowing that they were, that there was

423
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:58,920
anything legally happening to them. But of course I know them not necessarily personally so what

424
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,120
what happened to them.

425
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,400
But with that say, there are the type of people who,

426
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,440
if something that happened, they would not shy away

427
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,920
from talking about it.

428
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,640
- Hopefully nothing changes 'cause one leadership change,

429
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,840
and that can be a big dramatic difference.

430
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,600
We like to think that we have power, but.

431
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,760
- No, no, no, that's very true.

432
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,200
- For building our suddenly buys

433
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,280
if not very profitable company, things can change.

434
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,240
A centipilion error, I think.

435
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,080
Yeah.

436
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, so that is interesting that you brought up that topic.

437
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,240
I think before we dig into that,

438
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,840
I just wanted like cycle back something else.

439
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,640
So the changes that you envision,

440
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,120
like so you said like, you know,

441
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,800
companies should be more open to like sponsoring,

442
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,720
to encouraging contributions.

443
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,560
But do you?

444
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,920
- If there been a firm technology,

445
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,080
they are doing an actual risk to their bottom line

446
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,040
and their company and their customers and their data

447
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:04,040
because that's what it comes down to a lot when something happens by not investing in their staff contributing to it.

448
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:25,440
Like, this is how there can be larger sponsorship, there can be conferences, there can be et cetera, but just paying staffers to be contributors is a wonderful simple way to give back to a community that someone at least half time is focused on adding that or a documentarian or whatever it is.

449
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,280
like that is a logical way.

450
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,640
That is something out of my hands.

451
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,640
But there are a lot of things that happen

452
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,760
in the severely distributed.

453
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
It's one of the first remote communities.

454
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,440
Most open source projects are the most distributed

455
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,440
community is a lot that people get away with.

456
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,560
Harassment, gatekeeping, saying, oh, that's easy.

457
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,280
You can do that.

458
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,840
That doesn't help anybody.

459
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,960
having guidelines for how to speak to people,

460
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,040
having a code of conduct,

461
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,740
reminding people of the code of conduct,

462
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,480
making them read it before they join,

463
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,600
then actually having a way to enforce a code of conduct.

464
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,360
I do be through the new stack.

465
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,280
I do a lot of coverage of CoupCon and CNCF stuff,

466
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,720
but be the first to use as an example.

467
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,040
Maybe it's two years ago now,

468
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,960
'cause what is time for those times?

469
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,720
- Yeah. - I mean, this big deal.

470
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,120
There was an asshole white supremacist tweeting white supremacist stuff and they banned him from one of the cube con events.

471
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:42,400
Okay, yeah, that's great. They made a big example of it. Oh, look how great we are. But at that same event. I think so this must be like three years. It was back when they were in person before they went online. Now they're in person again.

472
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,880
I personally need four women that group to act cube con events.

473
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,320
- I can't leave this stuff.

474
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
- So they did one thing once.

475
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
- Yeah.

476
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
- Who gives a thought?

477
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,920
Like yeah, it's important to destroy what's a premises,

478
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,320
but guess what?

479
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
There's a lot more things you could do as well.

480
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,920
So you need to have an enforceable code of conduct.

481
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,160
You need to create examples of people if you need to.

482
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
You need to take receipts.

483
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,400
You need to then communicate with other communities

484
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,120
and find ways that they know that's,

485
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,080
'cause predatory people will just move

486
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,560
follow and do the same pattern in another community. So people need to be aware of it.

487
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,000
You need to take care of people who need to provide them basic human rights

488
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,960
if they're especially giving you free work, but they're doing anything.

489
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,400
You just need to treat people well.

490
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,960
Yeah, enough for sure. No, I agree. Do you think a lot of this, or some of this,

491
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,520
can be driven from a cross-reach level? What does it have to come from?

492
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,520
- No, there are certain things that have to come, not from the company, but from the open source leadership.

493
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,520
I'm not saying they're paid half of, what is it? 25, I probably butchering this.

494
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,520
More than half of open source maintainers make $1,000 a month or less all the way down to zero.

495
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,520
So these are people doing open source maintainers are overworked and overworked and underpaid.

496
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:15,600
which again, if people are, if companies are investing in it, maybe hire that person and pay them to do that.

497
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,280
Pay someone to run the community. If you are a company that even is investing in the engineering or is

498
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,440
reliant on that, but something happens really bad at that company, it looks bad on you. Also, if this,

499
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,240
and then from a business side, if the security is not taking care of things like that, like you can't do that.

500
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,000
So, grassroots, these are code of conduct.

501
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's something that is a requirement, like a check mark for women, even with enforcement

502
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,600
and all, to then go ahead and to even join.

503
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,080
So I think that needs to come from leadership and then it needs to be a priority, enforceable

504
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
code of conduct.

505
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,560
You need because there are certain things like saying who is the person that you contact

506
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
for stuff like that.

507
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,000
code of conduct is a feature within GitHub. I know GitHub is not the only way, but it's like 80%.

508
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,080
I'm sure that takes someone that administrative level to add that, things like that, but that

509
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,480
doesn't mean some of the community can't say, "Hey, can I do this? Can I help you with this?"

510
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Anyone in a community can volunteer to do these things. One of the other problems that communities

511
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,560
have is they don't have a pathway to leadership. They don't have a clear pathway to leadership,

512
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,800
which is very important because you cannot stress. Maintainers are overworked and underpaid. So

513
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:52,000
how can they do that? I'm trying to find right now there's some really great metrics coming out

514
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,960
from the chaos community and others that the Linux Foundation and Qcon is trying to do. So like

515
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,120
when you're talking about a different basic level to have a code of conduct maybe turning on

516
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,360
closed captioning during meetings, the next level is publishing documentation and then having

517
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:20,080
a contributor ladder. The next level is being transparent like you said being open and honest about

518
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:26,720
how issues are picked up. One of obviously if you're the first time there are drive-through

519
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,120
contributors and you're contributing for the first time and someone rejects your PR without

520
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:40,720
telling you why, you're probably not coming back. Statistically, we need more studies like this,

521
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,680
this is a 2017 study, but I see no reason for it to be different. Unless a woman is a very

522
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,680
well-known contributor like you know leadership or maintainer level in all in a community or really well-known.

523
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:13,680
She is less likely for her pull request to be accepted. If these names are blinded or masked to get rid of the gender, a woman is more likely to be accepted, which I'm sure their code is better because we are sexual socialized to perfection.

524
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,280
perfection. It's same in the statistic that a woman will only apply for a job if she

525
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,080
meets 100% of the requirements, which we know job descriptions or bullshit, but a man will

526
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,560
at 65% again, just on the binary. Similarly, a woman I think would just be statistically more

527
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:38,000
likely to be submitting code that is much better, things like that. So knowing that, having some sort

528
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,440
of flagging system to make it easier for newcomers to understand where to go, but not just

529
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,400
new, maybe their newcomers to your community, but they're

530
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,040
entering your project and they're like hardcore GitHub contributors.

531
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,760
So there's a new project in academia right now, but hopefully

532
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,760
we'll see the crossover, which comes is looking to automatically

533
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,480
flag issues and pair them with people based on their history

534
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,240
of contribution on GitHub over.

535
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,860
That's interesting. That would be a way to automate that. So there are ways to automate as well. So there's a lot of stuff. It's

536
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,300
Fabio

537
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,420
Of course, I believe this is coming out of there

538
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,100
That is the head of that project is coming out of the to-do group. I need chance or is it separate?

539
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:34,800
No, this is this is an academic who went on his own to do so now the next chance is

540
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,040
Partner academia. This is a constant problem that academia partner

541
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,760
AI, Deblonic tends to be a bit better than anything else, but you know, the next step, but he's

542
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,720
applied to give a talk of CoupCon, so hopefully he'll get that talk now. I encourage him because

543
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,680
so he can share his research and all to take to the next level of scale. Yeah, that sounds pretty

544
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,760
interesting. Yeah, that sounds pretty good. Something you mentioned earlier that had me thinking,

545
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,320
you were talking about somebody trying to fork something because it was in Russia or something.

546
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,840
That there was a huge pressure. This last February March for GitHub to ban Russian projects.

547
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which I don't think they did. And they did not touch that one. Yeah.

548
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,200
But there was definitely a pressure to that. But imagine people that are reliant on that code.

549
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Imagine there's ethics around it should it happen or not. And also when you cut off,

550
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,640
I mean, let's call Russia as continent.

551
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,360
when you cut that off, how are they getting access to people outside when you live under a dictator

552
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,240
regime? So there's a positive and negative to everything. And open source just reflects

553
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:54,760
society more because of its on-duckness. Yeah, yeah, that's a complicated one because often the people

554
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:03,960
writing that software is not for what's going on in Ukraine. And therefore, they're being

555
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,720
punished for living in a country that they don't necessarily agree with what's happening.

556
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,840
I mean, there's a lot of stuff. But it's still a form of sanction. No, it is.

557
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,560
Can sanctions work with our Megalomania? Yeah.

558
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:21,400
Dictator, we don't know, but in general, sanctions should logically work, but it could be deemed

559
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:30,360
dissanctioned. But can corporations now Microsoft own and get up? Can Microsoft have the power of

560
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,080
of a country to sanction either.

561
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,120
So there's that question as well.

562
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,560
GitHub, we look at it as like,

563
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,640
it is on my Microsoft, Simon LinkedIn.

564
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,200
- Yeah, yeah.

565
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,880
And a few years ago, I would,

566
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,960
I have not had like that,

567
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,580
but Microsoft has turned around, big time.

568
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,840
I just constantly see.

569
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,440
- Certainly for green.

570
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,560
- Yeah, I see so many good things coming out of them

571
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,760
and they're doing so much for

572
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:07,840
accessibility is incredible. Just yesterday, I noticed they have the ability and teams to have

573
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,480
sign language interpreters join your team's meetings. I mean it's such an obvious thing but

574
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:24,880
you know, yet they are the first to do it. And then I saw that whole range of gadgetry that they have

575
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,640
with the buttons and the joysticks that you can turn around and use it to

576
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,840
achieve. And it's all the parts can be into change to, you know, make it for

577
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,000
just your need. It's just incredible. And this is the benefit of having diverse

578
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,560
engineers on your team and user testing, but that can only come. The UK government,

579
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,920
the UK government, a hot mask. UK government digital service is very impressive.

580
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,920
It is extremely accessible because they started from the start. There are no edge cases. If everything is going paperless,

581
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,920
there are no edge cases. Everyone has to use it. And part of what they did was from the start, they hired blind developers and

582
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:21,920
different developers with one arm or different disabilities. Because guess what? Those are people who are neurodiverse, who are much more likely both all of these groups are

583
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,260
tend to be have higher levels of unemployment significantly higher. But guess what?

584
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,520
So you're doing a good thing, but also you're making a better project. And that's why open

585
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,880
source means, well, the source reflection of the world. That's why everything needs. But my

586
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,900
constant mantra is, if tech is the future, and open source is the backbone of the future,

587
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:51,600
because we're talking like 70% of businesses, jardeef code, things like that. Who is participating

588
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,320
and building in that future. And how are we damaging that future by blocking people from participating?

589
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,880
Yeah. That's my mantra. Yeah, yeah, I know for sure. In various words. Yeah, I know for sure.

590
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,680
So you also wrote a piece in that, you know, obviously it's very well-timed now with what's

591
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:17,920
happening in tech fear and layoffs. It's massive. And it's interesting, I think it's the ex.

592
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,800
No, sir, am I writing it?

593
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,960
And so the X, I think it's the XCO of GitHub that said,

594
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,240
all these companies know they're overstaffed,

595
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
and they've just not acknowledged it.

596
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,000
And now they're being hit with all these,

597
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,520
the climate of economic climate,

598
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,800
and they now have to acknowledge that they have flown

599
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,160
too high for too long.

600
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,640
- Okay, first we're not gonna talk about Twitter

601
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,160
because that is a different generation.

602
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,760
And that is an-- - Completely different.

603
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
- That doesn't make sense.

604
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,040
But L'Arthacal, who's someone I interviewed for the article,

605
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,920
someone that does is like an engineering leadership coach,

606
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
she said the truth is these companies are making up

607
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
that they could have laid off zero people

608
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,920
and it wouldn't have had an impact.

609
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,920
So this is, the companies that are doing this,

610
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,040
Besides like a Peloton, which kind of like lost its way post COVID.

611
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,400
And I don't think anyone was shot like we feel bad for the people.

612
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,000
And besides maybe Salesforce.com, we don't know,

613
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,760
but they were probably doing the same.

614
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,760
These giant companies that are doing layoffs right now,

615
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,760
meta or blot were doing hiring freezes, Microsoft, etc.

616
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,240
were hiring because they could.

617
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,160
There was time six months ago, even, where they had the money.

618
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,620
It's like, let's just all fight over developers.

619
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,320
Let's just fight over engineers and let's pay them six figure bonuses,

620
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,380
which good for those people that got those roles,

621
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,840
but then first last hard, first fire.

622
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,600
>> Mm-hm.

623
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,560
>> But it was irresponsible and it was capitalism.

624
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,320
That's what it was.

625
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,480
They had the money to compete and they won't.

626
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,000
Do I think overall this is where it's going?

627
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,320
I don't think.

628
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,480
So in tech, I think overall we are,

629
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,080
it's quite clear we're entering recession.

630
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,240
It was an irresponsible, like I can do it,

631
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,640
so I'm gonna compete and do it.

632
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,960
And hopefully those people had savings

633
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,880
that had those jobs, things like that.

634
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,480
But also the truth of the matter is,

635
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,360
none of these companies, they're doing it for stock

636
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,200
and margins and boards and things that are so separated

637
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,880
from the human being.

638
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,520
But it's basically its capitalism.

639
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,440
So that's the fucked up system we agreed to participate in.

640
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,700
So it's not great.

641
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,660
I feel bad for the individuals and their families,

642
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,520
but--

643
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,720
And especially when we're talking about,

644
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,640
we forget contract workers will be cut

645
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,740
so that security guards, cleaners for buildings,

646
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,380
cafeteria workers, because we know Facebook

647
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,120
or whatever we want to call these days,

648
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,960
famously has food, all these companies,

649
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,800
that food, things like that.

650
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,960
Those are the things being cut as well.

651
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,680
And nobody's talking about the workers

652
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,680
and those are the workers that will be screwed.

653
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,560
These are also the workers at least in the US

654
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,920
that are mobilizing a lot and unionizing,

655
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
so maybe not.

656
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,400
I believe Metas or Facebook, Papakaria workers

657
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,800
were some of the first tech unions,

658
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,280
so we'll see maybe they're okay.

659
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,280
But it's just, it was a downer of a week last week.

660
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,640
Let's be honest, because there were just layoff after layoff

661
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,520
it felt like a blood bath,

662
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:44,480
But it's just, typically they have contracts in California or Europe where they have some

663
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,800
sort of job security at least to get severance and things and hopefully they can get their

664
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
next job.

665
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,000
They just need to figure out how to go about that.

666
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,480
It's harder also for people that are like left behind at a company in the back.

667
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,480
So just sucks.

668
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,720
So they're also planning their move.

669
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,200
So there will be tons of moves in tech in the next couple months.

670
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,160
Maybe the wait till January, February, but yeah.

671
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,000
- It's okay.

672
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,120
- So there will be many things.

673
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,120
There's still a lot in demand and things.

674
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,400
It's just more worrying when,

675
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,760
like a Twitter I know he said,

676
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,680
"Let's not talk about it,"

677
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,960
but when he fires his entire ethical team,

678
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,280
which Twitter was a standout with that.

679
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,840
They were at least very transparent

680
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,200
and much more than any other algorithms we see

681
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,760
at the big fan companies and things like that.

682
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,680
Or whatever we call, I guess,

683
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,120
is not faying anymore 'cause they've all changed their names.

684
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,160
So I don't know what the acronym is now.

685
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:41,160
But yeah, so it's just wearing when that happened four days before an election, he fires most

686
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,360
of his content moderators things like that.

687
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,440
So we just, his companies are bigger than countries.

688
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,760
So they're the ones, but SMBs are still growing like 12% because they're used to being,

689
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,520
you know, more frugal and, you know, growing, but they're growing slowly, not growing dramatically.

690
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,080
They're not being irresponsible.

691
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,480
B2B seems to be doing well.

692
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,600
Salesforce is the only one that of the big B2B,

693
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,040
maybe you call straight B2B,

694
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,080
they had a big layoff too,

695
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,880
but it's mostly B2C.

696
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,760
Advertising is getting less.

697
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,320
I don't know if that will make the internet better

698
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,880
for everyone or not.

699
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,440
Like that's the first marketing is always first thing cut.

700
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,920
Community dev realm, this is gonna affect,

701
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,400
bringing it back to open source.

702
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,800
DevRel is one of the hardest jobs to measure.

703
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,840
So they often get, I just did across across my neck,

704
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,680
but it's podcast.

705
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,320
So I should probably say that I did a very able assemble

706
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,520
that I shouldn't have done either.

707
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,960
They get cut by I shouldn't have done it either.

708
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,920
Yeah, it's a weird time right now.

709
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,080
No, that's true.

710
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,160
But--

711
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,200
So we touched on accessibility earlier

712
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,640
and about the fact that something like the GitHub app

713
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,440
potentially being able to include more people.

714
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,440
And I mean, like for me, I can talk to some of this as well.

715
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,640
In South Africa, we are energy grid is severely constrained.

716
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,560
It's severely mismanaged and fraught with corruption.

717
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,260
As a result, we have these things, it's called load shitting over here, but I think people

718
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,920
know it as rolling blackouts, but it basically means that they're spurious during the day

719
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,880
where your power is just cut.

720
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,640
And depending on the stage, these different stages goes from 1 to 8.

721
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:50,040
You have more power cuts or less power cuts and they lost for a longer period of time.

722
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:57,960
Now the effect of that is multiple to small businesses, especially businesses in Massive,

723
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,400
there's a huge impact, small businesses are closing because they can operate when the

724
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,040
power is out and then they lose customers, but they still have to pay their rent at the

725
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,560
end of the month and they still have to pay their tax at the end of the month, even though

726
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,560
that text is supposed to go to maintain this darn

727
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,560
infrastructure. But

728
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
so

729
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,560
and the thing is one of the things that I've noticed is so

730
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,560
on a good day like right now when we're having a conversation and we have

731
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,560
electricity, I have a 5G connection and it's good. And

732
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,560
I the internet is constantly topping and I can have a video call and everything is good and

733
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:44,320
is good and you know it's not constantly buffering and breaking up. But when that's not the case,

734
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:54,160
sometimes I use my phone as a hotspot, but sometimes it drops to 3G. And for people with

735
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,600
3G access on a phone, the internet essentially does not exist. Well, as we are privileged to know

736
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,440
it nowadays, but yeah. So how we ur up with our all up basically is what you're going back to.

737
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:18,440
Yeah, and I think it's, I think it's largely due. And I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm guilty of it as well, even though I'm more aware of it, then most.

738
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:31,440
But a lot of the products are built by folks on the latest Macbooks using, you know, super fast fiber and they aren't thinking.

739
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,680
Yes, this is oh, I see where you're going. Yes, that open source and the world of tech is screwed if they don't have people

740
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:49,680
You know on poor internet with shitty devices flip phones or both now they're back or something. Yeah, but yeah, that is true too

741
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,080
Yeah, you need you need people involved also

742
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:59,100
By having the world involved you have much more easier 24 hour customer support or user support

743
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,080
There's always a business benefit and you could bring on so whoever cracks that

744
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,680
Is going to be the winner?

745
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,040
So the people that bring the next people online that was something that Mark Zuckerberg was really into for a while

746
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:21,140
But I haven't heard anything about it for a while his internet start up and trying to bring people online would like balloon to internet and

747
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,840
Africa and things but

748
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:29,880
It's definitely important because the internet saves lives. It provides medical training. It helps farmers understand

749
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,820
How to get rid get a better crop yield and be safer. Yeah, yeah, yeah

750
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,440
supports democracy

751
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
Yeah, if it's not controlled

752
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,640
actually for sure for sure

753
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,160
Yeah, there's so much more that we can talk about bad I know we're time constraints so

754
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,200
In closing

755
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,560
choose dance. One thing, what do you love and what are your hopes for the future?

756
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:08,960
About open source. Okay. Well, I just love the communities. I've been so many. And so I love

757
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,360
that aspect. I love that I've had this privilege through it to tell these stories and to mentors,

758
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,520
some university students over the last couple months about diversity, inclusion, and open source.

759
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,120
And I hope it just does better because you all need to do better.

760
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,720
So and out.

761
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,960
That's my final line.

762
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,840
You can connect with me on at Jemke Riggins on places.

763
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,080
I don't know if those places will exist by the time this publisher.

764
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,440
But yeah, so thank you so much for inviting me on this conversation.

765
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,560
Thank you so much, Jennifer.

766
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,880
I have a good, the rest of the day and a good weekend and I'll see you soon.

767
